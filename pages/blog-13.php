Wow, what an important call and what an amazing healthcare system we have. Isla's and Katie's surgeries were booked for June 30th, 2016. At this moment in time we were to prepare to fly back to Toronto next Sunday (didn't I tell you things happened quickly?). We were both full of mixed emotions and nerves. When Katie arrived home from work after "the call," we just stared at our swollen and yellow baby similar to how we lovingly stared at her for a full day after she was born. What kind of parents were we to be looking forward to such a large procedure and painful recovery process? But it wasn't that; we were looking forward to getting back a normal life in which we were robbed of almost eight months ago. We were looking forward to the frequent hospital trips and battery of medications to come to an end; or at least become much rarer than they were now. We were looking forward to ending the constant: "is this fart and sniffle her disease flaring up again? Or is it just normal baby stuff?" Of course we would remain vigilant, a transplant does not take away ALL risk whatsoever, but the concerns would be less. So many thoughts running through our heads, but "shit!" we gotsta get ourselves packed...<h2>Sniff, Sniff...</h2><p class="text-faded">We were super anal about cleanliness leading up to the flight, because if Isla fell ill in any way her surgery could be delayed. With how sick she was at this point in time, this was a very likely scenario and it scared the shit out of us. Turns out Katie, who never gets sick even though she works at a hospital, came down with one of the worse colds she has had in a long time. From that day until the day we left for Toronto, it was like I had a new roommate who was shut away in the basement and fed fish heads. There was no contact between Isla and Mommy, which was extremely hard for Katie. She was not able to hold her little gal right before a major event in our lives. I became fulltime "Fommy" 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, which is crazy exhausting. Let's just say the Purell baths and the tense moments were in full swing that week. Thankfully, all of that effort paid off, Isla never got sick, Katie started to feel better, we kept Toronto in the loop, and all went as planned... "Phew!"<h2>Love and Support</h2><p class="text-faded">Even though Sunday was only about a week after the phone call, it felt like forever. We accomplished quite a bit in those few days (it's amazing how efficient you are when you put your mind to it). We had limited support from the province and so there was still going to be quite the financial burden associated with our 1-3+ month stay. Katie and I are either very proud or very stubborn or both, which Katie's mother clearly knew about us, so she set up a crowd funding online for support (Katie's friend Tabitha also mentioned the idea around the same time). It's actually pretty simple:<div class="list-group text-left"style="color:#000"><button class="list-group-item"type="button">You pick out a crowdfunding resource online (we chose YouCaring.com because it is tailored to health related causes and it did not charge the donators any fees. A true fundraising platform not out to make large amounts of profit).</button> <button class="list-group-item"type="button">You create an account on the page and link it to a PayPal account</button> <button class="list-group-item"type="button">Katie's mom wrote up a nice blurb about us and what we were experiencing</button> <button class="list-group-item"type="button">Then you just shared it to social media</button> <button class="list-group-item"type="button">Then Bob is your uncle</button></div><p class="text-faded">We expected a few bucks here and there from close friends and family (which is all we thought we needed), but I guess people around the world do not like to hear news of a sick baby and innocently burdened family. We can't thank the hundreds of donors enough. The overwhelming support and messages sent to Katie and I still bring a tear to our eyes when we think about it. We were worried that we would get way too much money so we were planning to donate the remainder to the IWK Foundation, Sick Kids Foundation, and Ronald McDonald House Charities. However, we received just enough to make it feel like we were not even away from home financially. We still plan to be very involved with all of the foundations who aided us in our time of need and we have many great ideas on how to pay it forward (I am sure I will talk about it in future blog posts). Katie's boss and fellow co-workers graciously kept our house tidy and they provided much needed emotional support to our three furbabies while we were away. The staff at the Valley Regional Hospital blew through all items in a bake sale, which should have lasted days, and we even had an anonymous local mow our lawn (our great neighbour from across the street, man it's good to live in a small town). To all of you, Katie and I owe our deepest gratitude. We will never be able to thank you enough.<h2>In the Air Again...</h2><p class="text-faded">Again, I cartwheeled through the express security line at the airport with a dumb smile on my face, skipped up to the front of the boarding line, and wore all of the extra bags we could take on the plane. This time we brought Isla right up to the plane door in her stroller, which was glorious, and handed it over to the airport baggage worker people (again, I am ignorant to your actual job title and for that, I am sorry). The plane ride was a breeze again and "flew" by rather smoothly (my little lady was becoming a flying pro). Our intimacy with this lovely city was growing and there was no more getting lost from the airport to the Ronald McDonald House (RMHC). Up Express train from the Pearson International to Union station, TTC subway from Union to Queens Park (always needed to be an accessible stop so we could get the stroller up), cross University Avenue and walk along College Street to McCaul Street (where the house is).<h2>Pansies and Blood</h2><p class="text-faded">We had one day to settle into the RMHC and then Isla was admitted to the Sick Kids Hospital the following afternoon. The two days prior to Isla's surgery were dedicated to meeting with the transplant teams, signing consents, bloodwork, ultrasounds and X-Rays (we had concerns of fractures due to her Ricketts and her increased fussiness the last few days). We joined a research study for Biliary Atresia during our assessment trip to Toronto and another research team met with us for a study on transplant patients. If there was any way we could participate in a future of better detection, treatment, and data for Biliary Atresia we wanted to be involved. The one snag this time around was that the research team wanted blood from both of the parents and if you remember from previous blog posts, this big lug is a big pansy when it comes to needles. If I can ever avoid a needle I will, but with these high stakes, there was no getting out it this time (the things I will do for my little lady). When you walk into a major blood clinic inside a pediatric centre with a giggly little 7-month old and a sexy petite wife and say: "I tend to pass out with needles;" their sadistic faces light up with glee and the teasing begins. We had to wait longer in the waiting room because they needed to prepare a bed for me to lay on whilst I get that sliver of metal piercing my flesh. If our damn blood was meant to be taken we would not have all kinds of vascular tissue, muscle, connective tissue and skin covering it, but hey, it's for science. They laid me down on the bed, giggled some more, asked if I would like an orange juice sippy and talked to me all therapeutic-like in order to limit my chances of fainting. If you are a fellow needle-baby like I am, you know that all of the tactics they use to calm children just draw the process out and make it worse. I kindly said not to bother singing lullabies in my ear and to just get on with it. One blood tech even came over and sprayed a whole can of the cold spray on my arm to which the whole room blew up with laughter (laugh it up, fuckers!). The blood was quickly drawn (man she was good), the whole room stood there for a tense few minutes just staring at me with anticipation, and I looked back and said: "if it hasn't happened yet, it isn't going to happen." Just as a precaution, they kept me laying for a few more minutes, I assured them I was fine, I sat up, and I got that damn orange juice sippy!<h2>The Day Before the Big Day</h2><p class="text-faded">Isla was admitted to the sixth floor Transplant unit the day prior to surgery. The preliminary results of her X-Rays showed that she had a few fractured ribs and the ultrasound showed that her ascites had returned (man that girl is tough and here I am bitching about a little needle). It explained a lot. Isla's whole life she had always been super mellow and flirtatious. Her fussiness and cries always meant she was either poopy, tired, hungry or a combo of the three. The last few days leading up to our flight, she was cranky at the drop of the hat, she would hold her breath when we picked her up, she barely smeyesed anymore (smile with her eyes), and the only way she settled was when we held her close to our chests. The pain she must have been experiencing killed me inside. By the time we found out the news the Nannies had arrived! There was going to be no way in Hell that we were going to go through this great experience without Isla's two biggest fans there by our side. They were in Toronto with us for two weeks, starting the day before the surgeries. We spent the rest of the day hanging out in the hospital room having some fun and trying to get our minds off of things. The anesthesiologists came in and explained the risks of anesthetic as well as the role they would play tomorrow. One of the transplant surgeons visited and explained how the procedure worked. Katie would be admitted early tomorrow morning to the Toronto General and her procedure would take about 4 hours. During Katie's surgery, approximately 25% of her liver would be removed for transplant, but before any removal could take place the surgeons would need to be 110% sure that Katie's liver was suitable. They would determine this by performing a cholangiogram (injecting dye through her gallbladder to identify that her liver structures were normal and safe for transplant). There is always a small risk that once the surgeons visualized her liver they would determine that she would not be a suitable candidate to carry on with the donor surgery. This would result in the same recovery period for Katie and zero benefit to Isla (needless to say, this was a scary thought). After her piece of liver was removed and deemed suitable, the transplant nurse would deliver it to Sick Kids where Isla would be waiting. If timed properly, they would be nearly finished removing Isla's diseased liver and sending it off to pathology for examination. They would then put Katie's piece of liver in Isla to replace her old one, connect all of the vessels, and send her to recovery. Isla already had her gallbladder removed back in December, when she had the Kasai procedure, but this process would remove Katie's gall bladder as well (some disagreements with certain foods was a small price to pay in order to extend our little girl's life). This is a very simplified version of the whole process, but I think you get the gist of it; a big procedure.<p class="text-faded">When the evening rolled around, the doctors wanted us to head down to X-Ray again to perform a full body scan. They wanted a good picture of her bone structure in order to more accurately treat her during and after surgery. These were not fun trips due to the excruciating pain she was in. The X-Ray techs did their best to be gentle, but when she had to sit straight up in a dunk-tank-like apparatus, pushing against her face, while holding her hands in the air; you can imagine how painful it would be. After hearing the ear piercing screams she let out during the first X-Ray, I had to tag out and let Katie jump in on this one (I still had to sit just outside the room and listen, which wasn't much better). I do believe we figured out the results later on during our stay, but it turns out she had three fractured ribs and both of her Tibias broken (the lower right and left leg bone). Trying to settle a baby down for a good night's sleep when they have not been able to get a proper nap all day is tough enough, but adding the pain into the mix made it that much tougher. We did manage to get her down the night before surgery and she was surprisingly well mannered (just extremely exhausted I am sure). The Nannies left for the night to stay at the Ronald McDonald House and allow us to be together as a little family.<h2>The Big Day</h2><p class="text-faded">The night went by pretty smooth. I do not think either of us slept much, but Isla slept well and that is all that mattered. Katie met with her mom over early at the Toronto General in order to prep for surgery. My mom arrived at the Sick Kids transplant ward to provide Isla and I with much needed support before her surgery. Isla was to be prepped for surgery about two hours after Katie went down, but let's just say things didn't go according to plan. The doctors did prepare us for the timeframe by saying the two procedures have taken anywhere from 8 to 12 hours in total, but it was probably one of the most upsetting four hours I have had to wait. Isla had to be fasting for about 6 hours before her surgery, but they were running a little behind (I was assured this was normal and that Katie was doing well, but waiting in these moments are very tough). With the combination of the fractured bones and not being allowed to eat, Isla was the most upset that I have ever seen. Even holding her against my chest to snuggle would not console her. I performed a combo of laying her swaddled on the hospital crib, cradled in my arms, and tight against my chest whilst navigating around her IV lines. As soon as my arms began to cease up and burn from the pain of holding her, my mom would take her for a short amount of time (I did not let her take her for very long as I did not want to let her go). It turns out that they were two hours behind (8 hours of fasting for my little lady) and the nurse ran into our room to let us know that the operating room (OR) was ready for Isla (the nurse was starting to get just about as anxious and frustrated as we were at this point). The porter (people who transport patients and materials around the hospital) was not going to let me carry her the whole way to the OR room (down a floor), but I think as soon as he saw my mother and my face, he realized that he did not want to bark up that tree. The three of us arrived in the OR holding area, I filled out a form and answered some standard questions (i.e. any allergies? Has she had anything to eat or drink?), and the anesthesiologists arrived to wheel her into the operating room. At this point I was hoping they would arrive with a needle in hand so as to ease the pain my baby was in, but I knew this was an irrational thought. I had held myself together up to this point, but similar to when I had to kiss her on her forehead before her Kasai procedure, the tears and helpless weak feeling overtook me. Mom and I held each other and walked out of the holding area. I can't even explain the thoughts going through my mind in this moment and I would never in a million years wish for anyone to feel it. You feel a sense of relief due to having complete faith in the professionals at Sick Kids, but you can't help but feel that this may be the last time you see one of the best things you created in your whole life. So you better make sure that damn kiss on the forehead is a good one and be thankful for having your loved ones there to get you through the day.<p class="text-faded">Next, it was time to head over to the surgical waiting room at the Toronto General and wait for the news that the love of my life had flew through her surgery with flying colours.

It was definitely hard to see our baby girl all doped up with an IV, nasogastric tube (NG) coming out of her nose and a pulse monitor connected to her toe. That damn monitor was a pain in the ass, too. If it moved one nanometer, from one of her toe hairs to the other, alarms would sound and wake up the neighbourhood. Katie and I were good "parents of a patient," too. We were on the ball with keeping track of her poops/pees, feedings and medicine intake before surgery. However, right after surgery we unfortunately had a little break from this due to the IV and nasogastric tube. While these two things were in we were no longer needed for feeding Isla or providing medicine as this was all done via the IV. In addition, the nasogastric tube was in place to suck out all of the crap from her stomach. Our lively little "ham" of a daughter was now quite lethargic, which was the toughest thing for me to see. We were all waiting on the glorious FART. The fart was the sign that she could have the NG tube taken out and we could begin feeding her again. I never thought I would be in such anticipation of flatulence in my life. Luckily, Isla was in a hurry as well, since no more than two days post-surgery (December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2015) that puff of methane from her cute little buttocks emerged. Confetti fell from the ceilings, a choir sang in the background and horns blew throughout the floor. "Isla has passed gas!" The town crier proclaimed… Our charting began immediately with the first report being...<h5>Click <a href="blog-7.php">here</a> for full article</h5><p>There weren't many more eventful moments after "the bum burp." She went back to breast feeding and formula. A couple days later the pain medications were weaned off as Isla's mother and I remained vigilant. It's hard enough to measure pain in a speaking adult let alone a two month old, but we got good at determining what certain cries and demeanour meant now. In case you haven't been paying attention, we ended up spending Christmas at the hospital. To end off the "post surgery" story I will explain two things (out of many) that the IWK provided, which blew Katie and I away. There is a Ronald McDonald house built into the hospital on the third floor. They periodically put on events such as: dinners, decorating, gift wrapping, etc. On Christmas Day they put on an extra special surprise, in collaboration with McKelvies, where they served the traditional Christmas dinner. It was all very delicious with tender turkey, stuffing, potatoes, gravy, etc. The second thing was the "gift room." If I was a kid (don't even start, Katie!) and happened to stumble across this room, I would be sharting in my batman shorts while crying with excitement. The room was FULL of presents from floor to ceiling, ranging from puzzles to full princess Elsa costumes. Being parents of a patient, we were allowed to pick out two large items, a onesie, some books, and wrap them up on the spot for Isla's surprise first Christmas (see main picture on last blog post to see the aftermath of her Christmas). Until this day I am still in awe of how far the community and IWK Foundation go in support of the hospital. Take it from me people; your donations go to the right place and are very much appreciated!<h2>Heading Home</h2><p>Although our stay was a gazzilion times longer than we expected, we were tickled fancy to be leaving on the 28th of December. Just under a month in the hospital, after little miss Isla only being alive for just over a month, and we were finally heading home... Phew!! Until this day (almost 6 months since Isla was born), we still don't quite know what normal is for our little bambino; we probably will never know. Before leaving the hospital, one of the things Dr. R advised us of was Isla's susceptibility to infection. She now had a dirty organ (intestine) attached directly to a clean organ (liver) so infection risk was higher for her than the average baby. Any time Isla has any symptoms of infection or a high temperature, we need to head into the hospital and get her setup for tests to rule out the common cold, flu, urinary tract infection, etc. If it is none of the usual ailments causing the higher temperature then it could be an infection of her surgery site called Cholangitis. Knowing our luck so far, what do you think happened after about a month back at home? Isla generated a temperature of over 38 degrees Celsius, which is concerning (keep this in mind "new parents"). Just like robots, Katie and I packed a bag, gathered ourselves and rushed to the hospital (about a minute away). I called the IWK prior to heading to our local hospital and the doctor-on-call immediately called the Valley Regional to inform them of our arrival. We were warned at the IWK that we would have to advocate for Isla's condition when we headed into the ER with Isla having a fever. Due to her condition being so rare there would be a high chance of it being dismissed as the common cold as well as her father going to jail for slapping the dismissing doctor in the face. Thankfully this was not the case at the Valley Regional and her fever was taken very seriously. They ruled out all of the common issues which cause a fever and we headed to the IWK that night (1.5 hours away).<p>Just one more learning experience in the life of Isla. We ended up staying at the IWK for a week while Isla was on IV antibiotics. Cholangitis is hard to diagnose and can be very detrimental to her surgery. Needless to say, they essentially just pumped her with a bunch of antibiotics for at least a week and monitored her symptoms. Not a whole lot happened during this trip besides the "poop explosion surprise."<h2>The Poop Explosion Surprise</h2><p>We went through the regular cycle of nurses and "dial for dining" again during our week long stay. There was one bubbly blond nurse who was exceptional this time and became one of our new favourites. She just understood us, was easy to talk to, and very considerate. I guess Isla had a different opinion of her, though. I always got a kick out of said nurse, because late at night she would do her best to tippy toe into our room, undo Isla's Velcro "Swaddle Me" blanket one Velcro ringlet at a time (see Amazon store below. These blankets are amazing if your baby likes to pull a Houdini and kick themselves free of all blankets in turn waking up the whole house with their tired screeches), and quickly silence the IV machine's beeping. Henceforth she will be called: "ninja nurse." On this particular night our ninja nurse tried her best to check on Isla without a peep, but Isla wasn't having it. She screeched to the high heavens, and since Katie and I were experts on her cry-a-nese language now, we knew this was the "I just shit my pantaloons" cry. Katie quickly flipped over me on the single bed and landed on all fours in one foul swoop. She hustled over to the very apologetic ninja nurse, said: "no worries, kemosabe," and swapped out Isla's diaper. Problem was, during this somewhat smooth move (pun intended), ninja nurse was standing just a tad bit close to the crib. The poor nurse was actually standing right smack dab in the middle of the "blast radius." In the split second it took Katie to take one diaper off, say: "hot damn," and slap the clean diaper on; ninja nurse fell back in a slow motion reverse running-man. She was hit! Our small two month old, 10 pounder, released a heat-seeking, soft serve stream of shit in a three foot trajectory all over the nurse's scrubs. We all had a little laugh, Isla had a little fart, ninja nurse wrote down Isla's address for revenge, and we settled back to sleep on our two foot by three foot bed made for elves. The problem is, you can't get mad at something which can unleash such evil just to end it off with a face like...<h5>Click <a href="blog-7.php">here</a> for full article</h5><h2>Made it in One Piece</h2><p>We made it through the infection scare. Five IV lines later and some of the best poop colours Isla has produced and we were on our way home; for the second time in one month. We have not been back to the hospital since, knock on wood, besides Isla's monthly checkups/blood collection at the GI clinic.<h2>What Next?</h2><p>If you think the poop explosion was bad, you just wait to see what kinds of mischief our little ham has put her parents through, "post explosion." We are close to Isla's daddy being home all by his lonesome, Isla starts to develop more of a personality, the night of terror, and much much more.

That person is nuts! Just kidding, parenting can be tough, but again it is all about perspective. When you have a sick child it can be tricky to determine whether fussiness is due to their disease or if fussiness is due to normal baby things (teething, gas, etc). We are at the point now where the normal baby things are a breeze. I have seen first time parents jump at any sniffle with their babies and we have been so over that. When you have to be on guard for things like: blood in the stool, fever due to intestinal infection, jaundice worsening, rashes, excessive itching, fluid in the abdomen, loss of appetite, etc; a quick sniffle or whimper doesn't phase you anymore. All of this doesn't mean we haven't had our fair share of "hair pulling" moments caused by normal baby things throughout Isla's first half of a year.<h2>The Four Month Regression</h2><p>"Man we have an easy baby." "She can basically take care of herself." Those were some of the common statements Katie and I used to make in the first few months of Isla's life. In the grand scheme of things, that is still mainly the case, but we hit a little speed bump at four months. Leading up to four months Isla would cry if she was hungry, she would cry if she was poopy, and she would cry a little when she was sleepy. In fact, most of the time she would just pass out wherever she was or on whomever she was on when she got tired. I swear, she could be sleeping on a hungry shark in the middle of a bump'n rave concert. We soon realized that allowing her to dictate when she was sleeping (or not) was a huuuuge mistake. It was sometime in February, Katie and I were arriving home from a trip to Halifax (I will refer to Halifax as the "city" from now on. (Typing three less letters caters to my laziness so well). On this particular night, It was much later than Isla's 6-7pm bedtime when we started the bedtime routine. The routine was as follows:<ul><li>heat up a bottle of milk<li>start running the bath water to a perfect temperature (we learned that the perfect temperature was reached when the first thing Isla did when her butt touched the water was to let the pee rip)<li>plop Isla in the bath (plastic tub-like structure with a fabric ramp)<li>dry her off in her Klu Klux Klan-like towel (essentially has a hood on it which raises to the notorious pointed top like that lovely group of outstanding citizens)<li>baby massage ("It puts the lotion on it's skin")<li>clean that stinky surprise off her bum, leg and back<li>feed her the bottle (feed her the "milk" from the bottle for all of you literal folks)<li>read her a story (if it's mom's turn) or do a little dance with her (if it's dad's turn)<li>wrap her like a mummy in her Swaddle Me blanket<li>turn on the mobile's light and music<li>top it all off with a soother in the mouth</ul><p>Is it just me or does everyone else automatically think of Maggie from The Simpsons as soon as their baby starts sucking on her soother or dumb-tit or pacifier or sookie; whatever the hell you call it? (I have grown fond of dumb-tit ever since I heard that name a few months back. I think it caters to my child-like sense of humour or as some people call it "immaturity"). Unfortunately, this night was different. Usually she lets off a long comforting sigh and tinkle as soon as we sit her in the warm bath (much like the sound daddy makes when he passes a large amount of gas), but tonight she was fussing and crying… ok, we'll chalk that up as a fluke (maybe I bumped her leg when I sat her in the bath). Usually she looks up at me with that creepy smile (as stated in the blog introduction) when I lay her on her changing pad for a poop wipe, good-luck bum spank, and an anti-bum rash lubing, but tonight she was shrieking as soon as her head touched down… ok, now this is getting a bit out of the ordinary. Usually she rolls her eyes to the back of her head while we feed her that perfectly warmed bottle of milk, but tonight she was choking on it while she was crying in between gulps… shit! What the shit is going on with her? This was our first anxiety rendering experience of: "is her disease causing her pain?" "Is this just something normal for babies and our lack of experience is getting the best of us?" We tried everything. Group hugs, pep talks ("You can do this Isla, we believe in you!" "Please go to sleep or your mom and I are going to take up heroin as a hobby"), more milk, dances, double wrapping her swaddle, turning the room temperature up, turning the room temperature down, singing her lullabies… Oh! Dad to the rescue… she always settles when we put her in her car seat and swing her back and forth… NOPE… didn't work… Holy son of a Vondruke! It was getting to be close to 3am now and Katie and I were starting to get cranky with each other. There were moments we were just sitting there with blood shot eyes, swaying back and forth, staring at a blank wall, with our hair pulled out of our heads and a baby screaming in the background. Well there's only one more thing I can think of… let's go for a drive for as long as it takes. I'll fucking drive to China if I have to (by the way, a lot of the baby materials I mentioned above are on my Amazon store, check it out on the bottom of this webpage!).<h2>Let's Go Do a "B" & "E"</h2><p>There is not much area to drive in our small town of 6,094 people (yeah I just Googled that and that was the population in 2011, do some'in!). If we drove through the greater Annapolis Valley area we would have a whole lot more terrain to cover surrounded by farmlands and mountains, but I didn't want to take any chances. If we finally got this devil child to sleep I was pulling a U-turn (a Granny-like slow-ass U-turn as to not disturb our sleeping beauty) and we were going to drive the car right into her nursery, car seat and all (so we did not have to lift her out of her car seat to place her in bed. Protect the sleep!) We just finished our 50th lap around Paddy's Pub (that one-way stretch of road which goes in a circle in downtown Kentville and probably totals 1 km). All of a sudden the crying stopped, thank the lord almighty. Katie reached to the back where Isla was sitting and performed her routine "check if she's breathing" check. (Get off your high horse people, you know how ridiculous it is, but you've still done it). FINALLY! she was out cold (asleep, that is). We were on the home-stretch, literally, and all of a sudden I noticed an ominous sight ahead. God Dammit! It was a fucking road block. The blue and red lights were flashing, the cops were laughing and flashing their flashlights in the car windows (I guess it was 4am on a Saturday night and there are drunks out there thinking they are Nascar drivers). What freaking luck we have! If they only knew the shit storm they could potentially cause. Yes, I thought about it:<blockquote>"Should I rev this SUV up to it's zero to sixty in 50 minutes, fly through this traffic stop like we just performed a break and entry, flip the cops the bird as we blow past them, enjoy our next 12 months in jail while Isla gets a nice cozy room in a foster home at 4 months old?"</blockquote><p>Yeah probably not the best idea, but believe me, it was intriguing. Instead we begrudgingly pulled up to the traffic stop like the good obedient citizens we are, I rolled down the window, and the officer flashed his light in. I didn't realize it at the time, but the officer probably had his own thoughts the instant his flashlight illuminated our vehicle:<blockquote>"Two citizens, visibly distressed, messy hair, dishevelled clothing, maybe domestic dispute, ask the driver if he has been drinking, ask the woman in the passenger seat if everything is alright, put your hand on your gun and... hold on."</blockquote><p>Then he shined the light into the back seat where a baby was peacefully sleeping, immediately understands (must be a father himself) and says with a sympathetic tone:<blockquote>"Have a good night folks."</blockquote><p>We arrived back home and luckily Isla was still snoozing. We turned the car off, closed the car doors like we were trying to close them on a balloon without popping it, took Isla out of her carseat in a sloth-like fashion and ventured into her nursery. I think we got as far as her nursery door and: "WAAAAAAAAAAA WAAAAAAA!" I think both of our hearts skipped a few beats and we almost passed out with exhaustion. The anxiety set in again and we began to worry about her health. Maybe she was in pain? We should give the GI clinic a call tomorrow, just to be safe. The rest of the night was a blur, but I remember sometime between 5am and 6am Katie decided to strip down to her skivvies and cuddle with Isla on the couch. After about 20 minutes of the skin-to-skin cuddling I remember the crying subsided and I was dreaming.<h2>Do Some Research Ya Dumbasses</h2><p>We woke up a few hours later. The day was back to normal as well as our lovely little lady. Katie decided to do a little research and found an article on "4 month sleep regression." Essentially, when a baby hits approximately the four month mark their brain gets to a certain level of development where they will wake themselves up. Their sleep cycles begin to get all out of whack and some start having night terrors. I was a little skeptical at first, but I was willing to do anything in order to avoid another night of terror like the previous one. The advice from the linked website provided a solution. They recommended that babies need to be put on a sleep schedule from the time they are born. When they are Isla's age it was recommended to have her stay fed and woken up early in the morning. Do not allow her to stay awake for any longer than an hour and a half in between naps and have her nap no longer than two hours, but no shorter than an hour. You continue this routine of napping-awake-feeding schedule until they are about 6 months old and then you start to lengthen the awake duration. This all seemed like a lot of work, but I am here to say: Isla is now almost 7 months old and I stick to this schedule like it's a fanatical religion. I have it built into my alarm clock on my cell phone and besides the couple of times her fussiness actually was caused by her disease progression (keep an eye out for these updates in the next few blog posts), there have been no more issues with sleeping at night. During our regular monthly clinic visits to see the GI folks we can confidently say:<blockquote>"Isla sleeps well, barely ever fussy, eats well, man we have an easy baby, she can basically take care of herself."</blockquote><p>So, from one newbie to another, get those little punks on a schedule. It will save your sleep, sanity and keep you out of jail.<p><a href="http://www.babysleepsite.com/baby-sleep-patterns/4-month-sleep-regression/"style="color:#000"><strong>Sleep Regression Article</strong></a><blockquote style="color:#000"><em>Please Follow Giggles N Shit on <a href="https://twitter.com/gigglesshitblog">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Instagram</a> to keep up to date with the latest blog posts and the latest updates of our family story.

Life, pre-family, has the tendency to become monotonous at times. Wake up, get ready for work, scoff down some breaky, work eight hours, come home, cook supper, clean up, little R & R, wash up, bedtime, repeat. If you do not make an effort to be creative in what you do during the work days it can be very easy to end up in a rut. With a baby on board sporadic entertainment when you least expect it is a common occurrence. With a baby we have to make an effort to have mommy and daddy time. I have a somewhat sarcastic and childish sense of humour, if you have not come to this conclusion while reading past blog posts. Therefore, the following example of a funny situation involving more doody should not be a surprise (hence the name of the blog). Sometimes when a routine diaper change turns into a massacre, you just have to laugh about it afterwards, when the pain stops...<h2>Triplo Doody</h2><p>It was a regular spring evening and Isla was about 5 months old. I had just finished putting her to bed around 7pm and all was well in the world. She usually gets up crying for food around 10pm or 11pm. My routine during night time feeds is to give her a kiss on the forehead, lift her out of her crib ever so slightly, lay her on the changing table, whip off the Huggies Snug and Dry diaper, clean up the mess with some Shoppers brand wipes, slap on a fresh diaper, hold her in our wicker rocking chair, and feed her some formula from our favourite Born Free Breeze glass bottles (text version of product placement?). On this particular night when I opened her nursery door a tumbleweed blew past the doorway, a somber wind blew out the door and into the hallway, and you could hear a Western whistle wah wahhing in the background. I didn't know it at the time, but I was in for a gunsling'n shoot-out. When I laid her on that changing table she had a mischievous grin on her cute little button face. I am always powerless to this look and it draws me in with a sudden giddiness as I blow raspberries on her bare belly. In retrospect, I would say there was steam rising from the leg holes of her Huggies. As soon as the velcro lifted a familiar smell took my breath away. Let's just say that it is not a pleasant smell like a freshly dried pair of trousers pulled from a drying machine. It was the biggest mess she had left me to date. Up the back, all over her onesie, in her hair, on her feet, and even on the ceiling! She began to chuckle as if to say: "good luck cleaning this one up, my bitch!" A few hours later, two empty bags of wipes, a fresh coat of paint on the ceiling, and the job was done. I made sure that cute little buttocks squeaked to the touch. Problem is, no more fresh diapers were accessible… Now there is a crucial timeframe between butt cleaning and applying a fresh pair of diapers (I call this "purgatory." You're not sure if you're entering heaven or hell and you're being judged the whole time). There was a brand new unopened box of 240 Huggies Snug and Dry in the opposite side of the room (received from Amazon family; it's a sweet deal!). The problem is that the time it was going to take in order to run to that side of the room, pop the top of the diaper box open, rip through the pre-sealed bags of 60 diapers as though a baby calf was drowning in them; was going to push me well over purgatory to the point of no return. Fuck it! I was committed, so I made the trek to the diaper box knowing full well that Isla had her 6 shooter cocked and ready to fire at any moment. I managed to get one diaper free from these unbelievably well sealed bags. The problem was, you guessed it, Isla managed to fire off a round. It made a ricochet sound as it blew past my head while I was in a slow motion back flip of avoidance and I barely escaped the following onslaught with my life. Just as I was ravenously ripping the sealed bag of diapers open, there was just enough elasticity that my elbow whipped back and smashed the top corner of her solid oak dresser. At this very moment I was rolling around on the floor teaching Isla a whole new vocabulary of pleasant words while massaging my "not so funny" funny bone. I swore the bone was now shattered into a hundred pieces. Isla had just started wailing (not sure if it was my screams of agony or that she was just embarrassed about her second mess). So I am yelling in pain while rolling on the floor, Isla is crying and laying in a new pile of shit, and I managed to muster a few encouraging words to her:<blockquote>"Don't worry about the mess sweetie, it happens to the best of us, EVERYBODY POOPS! (while tears ran down my face)"</blockquote><p>Now I have a throbbing elbow on one side and a mangled bag of 60 diapers on the other side which has exploded all over the floor. I am feeling confident now that I have 60 diapers on stand-by so I lean in close to Isla and whisper in her ear:<blockquote>"Did he fire six shots or only five?" Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement I kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off, you've gotta ask yourself one question: "Do I feel lucky?" Well, do ya, punk?"</blockquote><p>Well, as you probably guessed by the title, Isla had another round left in the chamber. I had just gathered my composure after this traumatic experience, finished cleaning up her second pile of smoking shells on the floor, slapped some zinc cream on her freshly cleaned bum, and then it happened… again! It started with the furrowed brow and look on her face like she was trying to solve a related rate calculus equation. There was no more joking at this point and she began to wince while clenching down on her diaphragm. Once you hear that grunting sound (similar to the sound daddy makes when he helps lift uncle Eugene's full sized slate pool table) and the anus starts puckering, you have again passed through purgatory to enter hell. My first irrational thought during this split second was:<blockquote>"Should I plug it with my finger? No Evan don't be an idiot, she'll explode with all of that back pressure. Just let nature take it's course and throw your pride out the damn window."</blockquote><p>It was now the third time I had performed a diaper change on my little gunslinger whom I now realized could put some of my proudest toilet productions to shame. The showdown was complete and to say that I lost was an understatement. I was beginning to wonder if Katie had given birth to an alien-like shitting machine who can power a city block with the velocity of her bowel moments. Was her super cute baby exterior just an elaborate disguise? Obviously I was starting to lose my mind a bit. I had just faced an experience I would never forget from a 2 foot tall 15 pound human and the sun was starting to rise in the morning sky. I'll finally put her to bed and pretend this was all just a dream...<h2>Final Thoughts:</h2><p>Is it uncool when you are trying to sleep and all you hear over the baby monitor is a full blown fart fest? I mean like 99 balloons were fully blown and let go before a knot was tied. Is it even more uncool that your wife always tries to blame the sounds on your innocent little 5 month old? Just kidding, ninety nine percent of the time that baby lets out full blown, norseman with lactose intolerance, farts. I do not care how old or mature you think you are; a fart sound aways gets yah.<p>Food for thought...<blockquote style="color:#000"><em>Please Follow Giggles N Shit on <a href="https://twitter.com/gigglesshitblog">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Instagram</a> to keep up to date with the latest blog posts and the latest updates of our family story.

Complete strangers will literally stop mid-walk, pull a 180, stop traffic, roll down a mountain side, and swim across a body of water just to tell us how beautiful our little girl is (exaggerated a little, but very close to reality). Now if only we could start getting them to pronounce her name correctly. I guess it's our own damn fault that we named her an uncommon and pretty name (it's tough being beautiful). We even had someone argue with us once that there was an "s" in her name so she would pronounce it is-la instead of eye-la to which I said in my mind: "pick up a damn book lady, I hope the damn silent "s" in island doesn't knock you over the head." The stupidity definitely did not stop there, but I will give more examples later in this post. Now I know parents are always biased so I had set off on a quest to determine Isla's beauty quotient. This quest started during our time in the maternity ward when each nurse went out of their way to tell us that our baby was beautiful during the "alien-phase" right after birth. The mis-shaped, cone-like head with the beady eyes, and robotic-like movements. The cherry flavoured Jelly Belly colour and constant screechy cry, but people still thought this freak of nature was "beautiful." My scientific mind could not take it any longer and I immediately setup a research project to study this creature we had created. The project started with the ruling out of friends and family. Sorry folks, I really appreciate all of the nice things you have said about our little lady, but you can't be trusted. In true scientific fashion, I needed to eliminate any erroneous data by studying only people who have no emotional ties to our girl (complete strangers). I also had to protect Isla's security so strange fidgety men with moustaches, ice cream trucks, and odd women with a trunk full of Jolly Ranchers were also ruled out (sorry, I watch way too many crime dramas on TV, which creates my wild imagination). Next, I needed to train my ears to the faint comments such as "awwwwwwwwww," "gee-golly-gosh," and "oooh look baby! Frank why won't you have a damn baby with me you waste of space?" I also had to train my peripheral vision, because a lot of comments would occur when we already passed the person. They would stop mid-step, pull a "back handspring" to "aerial cartwheel" to gain a better vantage point of our baby, and make one of the aforementioned comments. Sometimes I didn't even need to train my eyes/ears, because people would shamelessly slam their shopping carts into ours, put up a roadblock of toilet paper rolls in the aisle, and say: "I just have to take a look at that baby!" These actions were alarming at first, but after a while I would reluctantly oblige to their demands while cocking my fist; just in case (babies make people go cray cray fo sheez). The next step was to alter my movements whilst pushing her in a shopping cart, stroller, or carrying her in her car seat. I had to transition from my fight or flight response towards crazy people to ignoring my innate reflexes altogether. I needed to switch from awkwardly smiling, pretending not to hear their baby fever comments, or bitch slapping people; to slowly stopping, turning around, and engaging in nonversation with these people (the things I do for the good of science). I had to measure these extreme comments and actions compared to the token ones. For example: a quick glance and smile, a "how cute" while still walking, or a gasp. Essentially the people who just weren't putting their heart into it. Please see the following graph for my findings...<h5>Click <a href="blog-10.php">here</a> for full article</h5><p>At the end of the day, who the hell really knows if their baby is beautiful or just a shit filled pile of snot bubbles. It really doesn't matter. What is it they lamely say? "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." All I know is that my sweet little girl is the prettiest baby in the land and if anyone says other-wise, I'll start naming names on this blog! P.S. I embarrassingly performed this study, no joke, just because...<h2>Sandal Scandal</h2><p>As Isla's condition worsened her skin and eye colour became more and more yellow to the point of almost glowing in certain lights. There was no more avoiding it; we had a yellow baby. For the most part people usually avoided the subject out of respect for our privacy, but there are always a few gems who ruin it for everyone else. Trust me, I don't mind talking about our little girl's story. I write a damn public blog and share it with the world for shit sakes, but it is all about the approach. Some people let their own blatant curiosity (or nosiness) cloud their judgement of social cues and being in retail for as long as I have been, you would think I have seen it all. I should know by now that some people's children will always pop up and surprise me.<p>The three of us were out shopping for a new pair of sandals for myself. Katie would agree, but this trip was looooooong overdue. Much to my lovely wife's dismay, I had been wearing a pair of yellow and black thong Crocs for about a decade now. Now don't worry, I never wore them with socks, I have more self respect than that. They were just so damn comfortable and squishy under my feet. I wouldn't have even attended this sandal purchasing outing if I was not forced into the inevitable. One of the happiest moments for Katie, in our 12 year relationship, was in the summer of 2015. We were heading back home from a local waterfall (Hells Gate or Three Pools). For those of you who have been, you know it is quite the little jaunt up and down the hillside on your way out. On this particular occasion I was wearing my trusty bumble bee Crocs. On the way down the final hillside I stepped just a little too hard to gather my balance and "snap!" In that moment Katie, who was walking ahead of me, whipped back around with a look of pure horror. I had made it seem like the snap sound was the sound of my femur breaking as I rolled around on the gravel hillside clenching my foot (I am tearing up just writing this section). After a decade of holding up my extremely powerful masculine body, my poor left Croc finally threw in the towel and snapped under the pressure. I even held a ceremony for them beside the SUV, took pictures and stared back at them longingly in the rearview mirror as we drove away (Katie with a look of pure glee the whole time). Either way, it was finally time to buy a new pair. I will not say the word "replace" as nothing could ever replace those glorious yellow rubbery bundles of joy. That long story was just the lead up and actually has no relation to the reaction the store clerk had towards Isla.<p>We arrived at a shoe store in New Minas which Katie recommended due to their availability of Birkenstocks (you would think she was commissioned by that company due to her pushiness for the brand). I am sure they are wonderful sandals, but I did not get any because they look like a pair of corks strapped to your feet. As we entered the store we were greeted by two older ladies working at the time. One obviously mentioned how beautiful Isla was and said she would be with us in a moment. I made the mistake of walking towards the other saleslady in the back of the store. She quickly pointed out that she noticed our baby was a little yellow. Just a note to all of you out their who haven't had a jaundice baby: this is not the way you want to start a conversation with a parent of a yellow baby. Usually the socially adept people at this moment notice my annoyed look on my ginger face or avoidant speak, but this lady clearly did not. She continued questioning me, like I was under arrest, in regards to our apparently unbelievably yellow baby. The conversation went as follows:<blockquote>Me: "Yes, I noticed that as well. It must be due to this rare liver disease which she has been inflicted with."</blockquote><blockquote>Floofy Saleslady: "Oh dear, that's horrible, was she born with it?"</blockquote><blockquote>sidenote: Everytime I hear someone say "is she born with it?" I can't help but sing in my head "maybe she's born with it, maybe it's MAYBELLINE!"</blockquote><blockquote>Me: "Yes."</blockquote><blockquote>Floof: "Is she going to need surgery?"</blockquote><blockquote>Me: "Yes."</blockquote><blockquote>Me: "Hey Isla, whaddaya say, should Daddy head over to the wall now and look at some sandals?" While I edged away from the nosey lady looking for a topic for her next tea party with her "well-to-do" lady friends.</blockquote><blockquote>Floof: muttering more incoherent questions behind me as I walked away.</blockquote><p>I was in the middle of trying on some sandals and I turned to notice the lady had now cornered Katie and was quizzing her on Isla's disease. I began wondering if she had been recently accepted into medical school and had many questions for an upcoming exam. That had to be the only explanation for her relentlessness, but it turns out there are just "silly" people out there in the world (Katie made me censor the actual adjective I used for the sales lady). Needless to say, I actually found a pair of moderately comfy thong sandals made of suede and rubber (not quite my old bumble bees, but they look nice and they'll do).<h2>Splish Splash</h2><p>Katie and I have heard a few horror stories now of parents trying to coax their children into swimming. It seems like for some children it is like you are asking them to eat a handful of liver covered broccoli while giving them a noogie. Clearly we did not want to experience this so Katie took right to Dr. Googlé and figured out how early we could put Isla into swimming lessons. Who knows if it'll work or not, but it should be fun at the very least. Turns out as soon as your child hits two months Acadia Athletics department will teach them how to swim (the most expensive University in Nova Scotia must be desperate).<p>We made it to two swimming lessons before the big trip to Toronto (stay tuned for this much anticipated story). During the second lesson we headed through the front doors of the athletic department, past the hungover girl at the front desk (who I am pretty sure we woke up), and to the family changing room. Again, people gawking at our pretty little lady along the way (or maybe they were wondering why she had such a golden tan, who knows now?!). It became clear that Isla was definitely the youngest and smallest child at the pool. Our class consisted of Isla, myself, the instructor, and two other ladies with their boys. I, being the jerk I am, immediately started stacking the two boys up against Isla. They were both much older and one, in particular, was actually held back a class because he cried when his face got wet. They were both cool little dudes though and did very well, but Isla showed them both up. I advised the instructor that Isla had been working on her backstroke and she had a solid butterfly, but they all started laughing like I was joking… On a serious note, the instructor did very well with the tools she was given. The lessons mainly consisted of the two mothers and I gliding our children on the surface of the pool water. We floated rubber balls and rubber duckies to the kids and watched them bounce off of their stupefied faces, thinking they would actually pick them up and start playing catch with them. I began to feel bad for the instructor, like she drew the short straw and was stuck with all of the floppy, bundles of flubby baby skin, which lacked proper head control. I do have to say though, I learned something from the instructor as she put an honourable effort into her lessons. She had mentioned to start early with splashing Isla with a modest amount of water on the face because that is usually what generates the fears later on in life. To this day, Isla gets face splashes from her sadistic parents anytime she comes into contact with water. Isla was a great sport about it during each lesson, though. She never once cried and essentially kept a straight faced death stare the whole time as she clung to me (obviously I didn't mind my pride and joy clinging to her protector). She takes after her mother with this "look" though.<p>She would have probably stayed in the pool all day, but I ended up calling it quits when she started shivering and acquiring some purple lips. I would thank the instructor and we would head back to the changing rooms.<p>On this particular day Katie was sitting on the side benches by the pool with the other parents. I was too busy to notice, but I guess during the lessons Katie experienced another aspiring medical professional (not really, it was an Acadia employee). She was heading from parent to parent to let them know that they were no longer allowed to sit on the sidelines because it was too distracting for the kids. They would have to sit up a floor behind some glass walls to watch. Before she got to Katie she had mentioned the rule to another parent. That parent had advised the employee that she would not be partaking in the seating arrangement due to her child having Cystic Fibrosis and would need her close by incase anything went wrong. The employees' response to this was to ask the mother how their child was doing now, to which the mother politely answered: "she's doing fine at this moment." I can picture Katie's anticipation now building after overhearing this conversation. After a few moments of tense conversation with the other mother, the overly bubbly employee advised Katie of the new seating arrangements. I guess at this time she asked which one (which child) belonged to Katie in the pool. I would have been a smart ass and pointed to me, but Katie is a much more decent person and pointed to Isla. You guessed it, the lady advised Katie that our baby was yellow like we were some colour blind morons. Again, I would have responded by saying:<blockquote>"Well I'll beef hooked, that is a yellow baby. Must be the tanning beds we have been bringing her to."</blockquote><p>but Katie being the lovely, but now annoyed person she is, responded by saying:<blockquote>"Yes, she has a liver disease and will need a transplant."</blockquote><p>Hoping that her bluntness would turn the woman off from a full on diarrhea of judgements and questions. Oh no, she wasn't done being nosey and eventually very rude. Have you ever experienced those people who realize what they are saying is not going to fly, but they keep flapping their gums and digging a bigger hole instead of just shutting up and moving on? Well she was one of them and ten-fold.<p>The ensuing conversation went as follows:<blockquote>Gum Flapper: "Oh… What's the prognosis of that?"</blockquote><blockquote>I imagine saying, in retrospect: "Not good, this will actually be the last swimming lesson for her, but it was setup by "Make a Wish." (I know dick thing to say, but this lady was appalling and this story won't even do it justice. She deserved to be shut down quickly even though saying even that probably would not have stopped her.</blockquote><blockquote>Much nicer Katie: "..." red-faced and visibly annoyed.</blockquote><blockquote>Gum Flapper: (while walking away): "Oh well if I could I'd give her my liver." She said in a overly phoney tone.</blockquote><p>Luckily, this instance, the goof wasn't as relentless as the sandal saleslady. Needless to say, some people have no idea how to react to something out of the ordinary, which is fine and expected. The problem is those people need to be a little more courteous and just smile and pass by. It does give me good blog material though so thank you silly people. An example of proper handling was a kind lady at the Scott's Bay beach. She walked up to us to tell us how beautiful our little girl was. She "asked" if she was a little yellow in contrast to putting out a public bulletin to us. We said yes, to which she simply said: "well it's good she's out getting some sun, I hear it's good for that." She paused a little bit to assess the conversation and quickly mentioned that she was getting a grandchild soon and wished us a good day. As my old grade nine math teacher so eloquently put it: "use the KISS principle people, you know, keep it simple stupid."<p>On a side note: I wonder how the employee has fared, because that day WAS the last swimming lesson we attended. Thankfully not for the horrible reason to which I picked fun at, but because we were soon headed to Toronto to get Isla assessed for transplant.<blockquote style="color:#000"><em>Please Follow Giggles N Shit on <a href="https://twitter.com/gigglesshitblog">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Instagram</a> to keep up to date with the latest blog posts and the latest updates of our family story.

I say monthly, however, it had been a while since Isla let us go a whole month without a hospital visit. They were becoming more and more frequent due to her condition worsening by the week. The GI team had been phenomenal with handling our worries and they were becoming very close to our little lady. Thankfully they had always taken Katie and my concerns seriously probably because only one out of the many calls to the IWK Switchboard had turned out to be a false alarm in the last six months. We had been to the hospital for ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen), for a fever, and many surprise blood draws. Isla was continually progressing in her yellowy-olive tan (probably should ease off on the Banana Boat tanner). She was vomiting more due to the disgusting medications she was on (for example one tasted like a handful of salt and was to be given three times a day). I was getting to the point of spending the majority of my day administering medications, cleaning up her puke, changing her clothes, and consoling her. I began to derive a strategy to limit the puking:<blockquote>Give medications right BEFORE eating (not during or after or you're just asking for it).</blockquote><blockquote>Any medications kept refrigerated needed to be brought to room temperature first (little miss Isla wasn't a fan of the cold liquids).</blockquote><blockquote>Medications given during naps were more effective. She was actually very good at lapping them back while sleeping (let's hope this doesn't develop into a sleep walking feeding frenzy later in life).</blockquote><p>We had tried everything and came out with many fine tuned strategies (I'm not going to list them all off so all you fellow BA baby parents don't hesitate to ever ask me what we have found works. We have had a lot of practice now and never shy away from any challenges).<h2>The Visit</h2><p>Back to the GI clinic visit. Our lovely, pleasant, laid back baby was beginning to show signs of her illness. Until now, if she wasn't yellow, you would not have known she was a sick kid. We have always said how fortunate we were to have a calm and happy baby however I strongly believe that how you act as a parent plays a big role in how your child acts as well. Katie and I have handled all of Isla's fussiness with a calm demeanor and we have never shied at bringing her around lots of people. So far so good! However, the shittiest part of Biliary Atresia is that at some point you will begin to see your child degrade in health/personality and the only fix is transplant. All of the medications, bloodwork, clinic visits, etc are just patchwork for this rare (little understood) disease. We were told when Isla was diagnosed, at a month and a half old, that the surgery she underwent was mainly to tie her over until her body was bigger and more receptive to a transplant. For all of these reasons, we issued a sigh of relief when Dr. R told us that we would be talking more about transplant in the next couple of weeks to months. Katie and I even noticed on that clinic visit that Isla's chart read:<blockquote>"failed Kasai"</blockquote><blockquote>"splenomegaly (swelling of the spleen)"</blockquote><blockquote>"portal hypertension (high pressure in the portal vein)"</blockquote><blockquote>"hypocalcemia (calcium deficiency)"</blockquote><p>And many other deficiencies in vitamins and minerals, which would otherwise be fine if her body was releasing bile properly into her gut. Katie and I could tell, qualitatively, that her health was deteriorating, but that chart put it into perspective for us. The thing is, even though transplant is a huge surgery and very risky, it was a fix to her incurable disease. We would quickly enter a fairly normal life and more importantly, I would not have to watch my pride and joy lose her sparkling personality. I would not have to watch her in pain nor feel like crap any longer. I am sure we will have our moments of illness throughout her life, but it would no longer be an expected future outcome for her. As soon as Dr. R had mentioned that her health was getting worse, I immediately became anxious for transplant to happen sooner rather than later. The rest of that clinic visit was pretty routine and a blur. We met with the social worker, we met with the nutritionist, the GI Nurses assessed her, and Dr. R came in and poked around her belly. You can pump all the nutritional supplements and medications into her but if her body won't absorb it into her bloodstream then it's just a continuous up hill battle to which you keep rolling back down.<h2>IWK Admission: Round Four</h2><p>You know how I mentioned that Isla had never let us get through a whole month without visiting the hospital? Well guess what...<p>It was about three days after the clinic visit, I brought Isla to see the family doctor for her 6 month vaccines (yes we vaccinate and no she doesn't have autism. Don't be stupid people and vaccinate your children. Something we can no longer benefit from; not by choice). Anyways, this was the first time we had seen our GP since Isla was diagnosed with Biliary Atresia and the poor woman felt horrible. Isla had her shots, the scattered nurse left me in the room for 30 minutes (aka forgot about us), I said "fuck it," and we went home. However during the visit the GP noticed some concerning soft spots on the back of Isla's head (fontanels) which should have been closed at 6 months of age. She referred us to the local pediatrician to have a more thorough exam (the same doctor who referred us to IWK for BA). This visit was a week later and during that time her jaundice started to take on an almost brown hue and her lovely ascites returned. We went over everything with the pediatrician, he was also worried about the soft spots as well as the ascites, so he referred us to the IWK. He even stayed well passed his working hours to make sure the doctors at IWK understood the severity of his concerns. The next day we were "on the road again" to get admitted back on the pediatric unit at the IWK.<p>No one really knew what to do about the soft spots, but they were all fairly certain that it was due to her underdeveloped bones. This was caused by her severe vitamin D deficiency, which would later be diagnosed as Ricketts before getting discharged. Their main concern was the worsening jaundice and returned ascites to which they treated with IV diuretics again (make you pee drugs). They worked right away and as soon as Isla started feeling relief from the abdominal pressure, she began to show signs of her silly old self again. It wasn't long before we were discharged (just under a week), but this time it was on a different note. Before leaving the hospital the doctor on call, did not want to make a decision for our GI doctor, but made it very clear that due to Isla's returned ascites and malnutrition that she would be moving towards transplant as soon as possible. She was correct. Dr. R agreed and we met back at the GI clinic early the following week. There wasn't much more to learn from the GI team this trip. It was mainly just to confirm our trip to Toronto. The bulk of the visit was to go over all of the financials and technicalities involved with our stay in Toronto. We were planning to leave at the end of the week to start all of Isla's testing that coming Monday (thankfully, things move very quickly once the decision to get assessed in Toronto has been decided). This trip would have us meet with the experts in pediatric liver transplant to determine how urgently Isla would need one.<h2>Bring it on!</h2><p>Onto another adventure; Isla's first flight. At 7 months old this child had more life experience than some adults I know. I will let you know how that went on the next post... to be continued!<blockquote style="color:#000"><em>Please Follow Giggles N Shit on <a href="https://twitter.com/gigglesshitblog">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Instagram</a> to keep up to date with the latest blog posts and the latest updates of our family story.

Isla, Katie, and my first big trip to the big city. Pediatric Liver transplants are not performed in the Atlantic provinces so all of us crazy Maritimers and Newfies are shipped off to Toronto for these procedures. However, this trip would not be for transplant, rather it would be to meet with the transplant team and have Isla assessed. Depending on the results for her assessment there would be three different outcomes:<ol><li>She would be in need of transplant as soon as possible.<li>She would need a transplant, but would be stable enough to wait a bit longer.<li>She would not be in need of transplant anytime soon.</ol><h2>Baby at 39,000 Feet</h2><p>You take flying for granted before a baby comes along. For most people there is enough anxiety when hopping on that tin can in the sky. Adding a baby to the mix and here comes a whole new slew of anxiety. I am far from a nervous flyer, but I definitely had my concerns with bringing an 8 month old on a plane. What if she's screeching to the high heavens the whole time? What if she shits all over herself and me? What if she lets one of her adult farts rip and everyone thinks it was me? The anxiety arises due to worrying about all of the other passengers on the plane. Everyone is in such close proximity that you hear, smell, and feel everyone so I am always conscientious of that. People actually get annoyed when a baby is crying on a plane, like it can actually be prevented with some baby chewable Ativan or something. So, you all probably know me well enough by now, and when people are being morons I tend to fight it with sarcasm (probably why I have very few friends, but hey, I have fun). Here's the truth though, the following clip from one of my favourite comedians explaining this exact situation, is how I got over all of my potential anxiety to "babies on a plane."<h5>Click <a href="blog-12.php">here</a> for full article</h5><p>Turns out, Isla loved flying! Thankfully she was a flying superstar so I did not have to "take her out" for the selfish passengers. Let's rewind for a second. Who woulda thunk it, that there are actual perks to travelling with a baby? My wife and mother are keeners and assured me that we needed to arrive at the airport THREE hours before a flight, which I do not think I have ever done. Of course, I disputed this and of course I lost the battle. We arrived at the airport three hours before the flight, checked in on the airport robots, checked our luggage, they wrapped her stroller in a body bag, and we were finished stage one. The first perk arose during this stage and that was that you are allowed to bring extra baggage on the plane due to flying with a baby. The second perk arose at stage 2. I looked like an idiot when we arrived at the security checkpoint and there was a huge, slowly moving line. Katie gave me a smug, yet satisfied, "I told you so," look. Before we lost our shit about missing our flight while navigating this maze, a hole in the ceiling emerged and a light shone down from the heavens onto a lone security guard. A choir was singing hallelujah in the background and the security officer's teeth twinkled as he said:<blockquote>"You guys travelling with a baby? Well come on down, we have a special line just for you."</blockquote><p>Of course I was cartwheeling down this line while waving at all the poor suckers who decided not to rent a baby for this plane ride. I looked at Katie when we arrived at the security check point in record time and proclaimed that I knew this would happen the whole time. That's why I thought arriving three hours early was ridiculous. When Isla is too old to qualify us for this lineup then we will have to trade her in for a new baby (perk #2). The third and final perk was realized when they started boarding the plane. You know, when they call on all the fancy pants business men/women, people who need assistance and BABIES! Probably one of the only moments in my life when I would walk up to someone (airplane ushers – people who call you up to board. I clearly do not know what they are called) and say: "BAM! Yeah that's right I got myself one of those baby thingy's.<p>Katie had the smart idea to purchase the Plus seats on our WestJet flight so that we had an extra space between us. I thought it was a good idea because I wouldn't want Isla and I squeezed up next to a ginormous sweaty Newman-like dude for the whole 2-hour flight. To all of you potential aero-baby parents out there, it's well worth the extra money, I tell ya hwhat. As I said earlier, the flight was a breeze. The stewardess' gawked at our lovely little gal, she had a couple of sobby moments, and then slept for most of the flight. I learned a lot about changing a baby on a plane (I will discuss this on a future post) and it turns out that our little adventurer loves landing (probably why I always risk a speeding ticket every time she is in the car with me. As stated before: "she likes to move it move it!"). One of the lovely airport personnel at the end of the flight advised us that we could actually bring her right up to the plane doors in her stroller (would've been nice to know earlier, but hey, yah live and yah learn).<h2>The McChicken House</h2><p>We arrived in Toronto later in the evening and we somehow half haphazardly navigated the UP Express train as well as the subway to the Discovery District of the city. Some goofball back home told us that the Ronald McDonald House was just across the street from the two hospitals (Sick Kids and Toronto General) so I set my navigation to those buildings, thinking that we would just stumble upon the house when we arrived. Well a couple blocks in the other direction, some slight bickering between Katie and I, some of Isla's "my parents are morons" glances and we made it to our destination. Well, holy crap, this place was nice! I was thinking it would be some run down, half-way house-type place above a McDonalds restaurant, where a goofy clown statue would welcome us via a drive-thru PA system with complimentary Big Macs. Boy was I wrong… It was a beautiful, modern, 4 level, brick apartment complex tucked away in a quiet residential area behind the hospitals. When you pulled up to the main entrance you were met with a perfectly manicured property, a finely lit sign which read the words "Ronald McDonald House," a light brick wall, leading to a black cast iron fence. The next area we began to appreciate more as the temperature became as hot as Hades. The first set of two doors would get you into the building where you would be slapped in the face with some glorious air conditioned air. I get overheated very easily due to being a big ginger constantly on fire, so I looked like the girls from those old Herbal Essence commercials in the shower having their "O" moments. At first I acquired some awkward stares from the tenants of the building, but they immediately understood as soon as that glorious air hit their faces.<h5>Click <a href="blog-12.php">here</a> for full article</h5><p>The building housed something in the area of 80 families. There were two huge kitchens on either side of the dish pit, where about 4 times a week different companies would visit the house to cook a wide variety of home cooked meals. There were always things going on for the kids, such as wood-working, face-painting, and movie night; to name a few. The rooms were equivalent to a well cleaned and prepared apartment less the kitchenette. I could go on for days about how great a place the Ronald McDonald House Charities Toronto is, but I have much more to talk about in this post. I will end the description of the house on this note: They meet the mark for making you feel right at home during a potentially stressful time in your life and I cannot thank McDonald Charities and the staff enough for creating such an important place.<h2>Assessment – Week 1</h2><p>This week was fairly uneventful. The hospital mainly wanted to meet with us, educate us on the process of transplant, and gather info on Isla. The transplant team at Sick Kids were phenomenal. They were all very professional, thorough with their explanations, and clearly took their important roles very seriously. We spent most of our time with Jennifer, a bubbly nurse in the department whom would be following our little lady, before, during and after transplant. During the first week we realized that we were very fortunate to be surrounded by so much medical and scientific knowledge throughout our lives. We couldn't imagine how overwhelming all of the information would be for people less savvy in the medical sciences. They were always very considerate of me, not knowing I had a degree in Biochemistry (and that I am generally just a genius), and they always asked if they needed to re-explain anything. I guess my occupation of Sales Coordinator and Fommy probably threw them off a bit (not many people in retail were stupid enough to bust their ass in a 4-year science degree). The first round of diagnostics included good old fashioned bloodwork and an ultrasound of her liver. If anyone ever had a choice on which organ to be diseased it would be smart to select the liver. Don't get me wrong, it has its fair share of difficulty, but it mainly regenerates itself, can support a live organ donation, and only requires the same blood type as a prerequiite for donation. Thankfully, Katie and I have always had a strong focus on health and nutrition in our house so one of us would at least pass that requirement. I can't imagine how guilty we would feel if we could not help provide our daughter a second chance at a normal life all because of something as preventable as poor personal health (keep that in mind all you lazy, binge drinking, smokers out there. Some day you could quite literally be hurting more people than just yourself. Well smokers usually do hurt other people, but that's a different rant for a different time).<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting tests Isla had was the calorimetry test. Katie and I started laughing when the technician had explained that the test would involve a fishbowl-like apparatus being placed over her head for 30 minutes in which she would have to remain still without crying. We wished her the best of luck, but were quite surprised that she actually did a good job for the first 15 to 20 minutes. The iPad we used for distraction through the glass of her fishbowl helmet worked quite well. Nothing but King Julien was going to keep her calm and still for 30 minutes. The technician advised us that she would try to extrapolate the required data the best she could to which we later learned was deemed inconclusive. Waste of time, but definitely an entertaining half an hour. Oh, by the way, this test was to determine her calorie output/intake so as to provide her an adequate amount of nutrition.<p>Next, onto the GFR test. The team here wanted to determine how well Isla's kidneys were functioning since there is a potential for kidney problems associated with Biliary Atresia. This test brought back flashbacks of the HIDA scan. If you remember from the "Bomb Drop" posts, it involved an injection of radioactive dye into her veins and being placed into a large MRI-like machine so that they could watch the dye filter out of her bile ducts into her gut. Well, this one was very similar with the exception of the organ system they were monitoring. For the GFR, in contrast to the HIDA scan, they would be monitoring the ability of her kidneys to filter out the dye. One added benefit was that I would have to come back every hour for the next three hours so they could watch and see if all of the dye had been excreted from her body. Ah well, it gave me lots of time to learn the complete blueprint of both the new and old sections of the hospital.<p>In conclusion, after the first day Jennifer was pretty confident that Isla would be needing a transplant as soon as possible. Her kidneys were perfect, but the kicker was how malnourished she was. The liver is a damn important organ and is required in order for our bodies to digest a lot of vitamins and minerals. These vitamins are crucial for proper neurological, organ, and bone development. Isla was severely deficient in vitamin D, phosphate, and calcium, which are all needed for bone growth. Due to this she was diagnosed with a disorder which usually only plagues third world countries; Ricketts (underdeveloped or soft bones). You can pump her full of all of the supplemental vitamins, minerals and drugs you want but if her body won't accept them into the bloodstream then you're just creating some very expensive pee (similar to all those beef heads out there jamming all those powerlifting supplements into their bodies. Isla is almost as strong as them, too). Needless to say, Isla was put on the donor recipient list for both Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Every few weeks or as Isla's disease progressed, she would slowly creep up priority on that list (for infant liver transplants you start pretty far up on the list to begin with). It's a potentially long and risky process to which one tragic event in one family leads to saving another (one otherwise healthy individual has to die in order to provide our child an extended life. Pretty morbid and not a perfect system). Thankfully, as stated earlier, Isla decided to go and get her liver sick, which would allow one of us to donate a piece of ours to her. My hope is that one-day Stem Cell research will lead to a world where it will be unnecessary for people to pass away while waiting for an organ.<h2>Assessment – Week 2</h2><p>Normally the process involves a flight to Toronto to get your child assessed, you head home, come back to Toronto for the transplant or to be assessed as an adult live donor (whichever comes first). We were 100% certain that we wanted to be assessed to donate a portion of our liver so we advised the transplant team of this and they were extremely accommodating. We saved, having to take another trip back and forth to Toronto and Katie immediately proceeded with her assessment the following week after Isla's assessment. Again, nothing super eventful happened this week. I took Isla to a few more appointments while Katie met with the transplant team at the Toronto General Hospital. The surgery involves quite a bit of coordination between the two hospitals, so much so that the actual transplant surgeons work at both locations. There is a lot of education and precaution taken for the live donor, because the very fact that you are taking a healthy individual and putting them under otherwise unnecessary health risks, goes against everything that doctors stand for. It goes to show the enormity of benefits live donation has over deceased. They only take organs from deceased donors who have healthy organs which still have blood flow (therefore they have to be brain dead and on life support). This leads to another important issue with deceased donation, which is the rarity of this type of death occurring to and otherwise healthy individual who has signed up to be an organ donor. One other issue deceased donation has in comparison to live donation is that you really do not know what that organ has been through in the donor's lifetime (only what has been medically recorded). All of these issues are important to note, however, if a deceased organ becomes available before you come back to Toronto for transplant, then they proceed with the transplant using the deceased organ as a standard. We would receive a call, one of us would hop on the "air ambulance" with Isla and immediately fly back to Toronto for the surgery (pretty intense stuff, which I only appreciated in TV dramas up until now). So, Katie was educated in all of the risks, what would be involved with the surgery (on her part), she met with a psychiatric nurse (to determine if she was being coerced, paid, under drug influence, and to assess her general psychological state leading up to her decision to donate), her own MRI/CT scan of her liver (she claims that the dye injected for this test lead to her feeling like she was on fire and peeing herself at the same time; lovely), and a shit tonne of bloodwork (26 vials to be exact, which would probably have killed me).<p>After two busy weeks in Toronto, we were to head home and await the call to see if Katie could donate. If not, I was to head back to Toronto and go through the same tests. Mothers tend to be the more appropriate candidates due to the smaller size of their organs and due to males having generally more fat on their organs (so we were banking on Katie getting approved and petrified that our girl would have to wait for a deceased liver whilst deteriorating more and more in her own health). If Katie was approved, they were prepared to book her and Isla into surgery at the end of the month (about 3 weeks away. It all happens very fast at this point). We arrived back home and in just shy of a week Katie had received the call. She was preparing to administer an interview at her work when the call occurred. She was on the phone for about 15 minutes and then she had to go into the interview straight faced and knowing that she was approved to save our daughter's life (pretty heavy). She immediately called me after the interview, her poopy-faced boss therefore found out before I did, and I may have peed a little with excitement... just kidding, about the pee. Probably the next most emotionally taxing situation I have experienced after the birth of my first baby girl.<p>Next, you'll all learn the juicy details of the most important, stressful, emotionally taxing months of my life...<blockquote style="color:#000"><em>Please Follow Giggles N Shit on <a href="https://twitter.com/gigglesshitblog">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Instagram</a> to keep up to date with the latest blog posts and the latest updates of our family story.
