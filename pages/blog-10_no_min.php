                    <hr class="light">

                    <p itemprop="description" class="text-faded">We arrived at the six month mark in May. Our confidence in parenting and routine had increased  ten fold. Our months included regular visits to the blood lab to obtain results for Isla’s liver treatments as well as GI clinic visits. The lovely staff at the blood lab started to anticipate Isla's visits with great joy to which I always said: "Thank you, nothing personal, but I wish she was beloved by a different group of people.”</p>

                    <h2>Beauty Quotient, by Evan Marshall <em>et al</em></h2>

                    <p class="text-faded">I'm not surprised though. Complete strangers will literally stop mid-walk, pull a 180, stop traffic, roll down a mountain side, and swim across a body of water just to tell us how beautiful our little girl is (exaggerated a little, but very close to reality). Now if only we could start getting them to pronounce her name correctly. I guess it's our own damn fault that we named her an uncommon and pretty name (it's tough being beautiful). We even had someone argue with us once that there was an "s" in her name so she would pronounce it is-la instead of eye-la to which I said in my mind: "pick up a damn book lady, I hope the damn silent "s" in island doesn't knock you over the head." The stupidity definitely did not stop there, but I will give more examples later in this post. Now I know parents are always biased so I had set off on a quest to determine Isla's beauty quotient. This quest started during our time in the maternity ward when each nurse went out of their way to tell us that our baby was beautiful during the "alien-phase" right after birth. The mis-shaped, cone-like head with the beady eyes, and robotic-like movements. The cherry flavoured Jelly Belly colour and constant screechy cry, but people still thought this freak of nature was “beautiful.” My scientific mind could not take it any longer and I immediately setup a research project to study this creature we had created. The project started with the ruling out of friends and family. Sorry folks, I really appreciate all of the nice things you have said about our little lady, but you can’t be trusted. In true scientific fashion, I needed to eliminate any erroneous data by studying only people who have no emotional ties to our girl (complete strangers). I also had to protect Isla’s security so strange fidgety men with moustaches, ice cream trucks, and odd women with a trunk full of Jolly Ranchers were also ruled out (sorry, I watch way too many crime dramas on TV, which creates my wild imagination). Next, I needed to train my ears to the faint comments such as “awwwwwwwwww,” “gee-golly-gosh,” and “oooh look baby! Frank why won’t you have a damn baby with me you waste of space?” I also had to train my peripheral vision, because a lot of comments would occur when we already passed the person. They would stop mid-step, pull a “back handspring” to “aerial cartwheel” to gain a better vantage point of our baby, and make one of the aforementioned comments. Sometimes I didn’t even need to train my eyes/ears, because people would shamelessly slam their shopping carts into ours, put up a roadblock of toilet paper rolls in the aisle, and say: “I just have to take a look at that baby!” These actions were alarming at first, but after a while I would reluctantly oblige to their demands while cocking my fist; just in case (babies make people go cray cray fo sheez). The next step was to alter my movements whilst pushing her in a shopping cart, stroller, or carrying her in her car seat. I had to transition from my fight or flight response towards crazy people to ignoring my innate reflexes altogether. I needed to switch from awkwardly smiling, pretending not to hear their baby fever comments, or bitch slapping people; to slowly stopping, turning around, and engaging in nonversation with these people (the things I do for the good of science). I had to measure these extreme comments and actions compared to the token ones. For example: a quick glance and smile, a “how cute” while still walking, or a gasp. Essentially the people who just weren’t putting their heart into it. Please see the following graph for my findings...</p>

                            <p>Isla’s Beauty Quotient <em>et al</em>. The data in the chart was gathered during a one month period in Isla’s life. It was a single blind test sampling of a random group of 100 strangers from Nova Scotia and Toronto. Crazies indicate a higher quotient whereas half-assers indicate a lower quotient. There were no subjects who claimed that the tested subject was clearly ugly, but we will allow for a 1% error due to this possibility. Findings indicate a 75% beauty quotient supporting the hypothesis that Isla’s beauty was well above average.</p>

					<p class="text-faded">At the end of the day, who the hell really knows if their baby is beautiful or just a shit filled pile of snot bubbles. It really doesn’t matter. What is it they lamely say? “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” All I know is that my sweet little girl is the prettiest baby in the land and if anyone says other-wise, I’ll start naming names on this blog! P.S. I embarrassingly performed this study, no joke, just because...</p>
                    
                    <h2>Sandal Scandal</h2>

                    <p class="text-faded">As Isla’s condition worsened her skin and eye colour became more and more yellow to the point of almost glowing in certain lights. There was no more avoiding it; we had a yellow baby. For the most part people usually avoided the subject out of respect for our privacy, but there are always a few gems who ruin it for everyone else. Trust me, I don’t mind talking about our little girl’s story. I write a damn public blog and share it with the world for shit sakes, but it is all about the approach. Some people let their own blatant curiosity (or nosiness) cloud their judgement of social cues and being in retail for as long as I have been, you would think I have seen it all. I should know by now that some people’s children will always pop up and surprise me. </p>

                    <p class="text-faded">The three of us were out shopping for a new pair of sandals for myself. Katie would agree, but this trip was looooooong overdue. Much to my lovely wife’s dismay, I had been wearing a pair of yellow and black thong Crocs for about a decade now. Now don't worry, I never wore them with socks, I have more self respect than that. They were just so damn comfortable and squishy under my feet. I wouldn't have even attended this sandal purchasing outing if I was not forced into the inevitable. One of the happiest moments for Katie, in our 12 year relationship, was in the summer of 2015. We were heading back home from a local waterfall (Hells Gate or Three Pools). For those of you who have been, you know it is quite the little jaunt up and down the hillside on your way out. On this particular occasion I was wearing my trusty bumble bee Crocs. On the way down the final hillside I stepped just a little too hard to gather my balance and “snap!” In that moment Katie, who was walking ahead of me, whipped back around with a look of pure horror. I had made it seem like the snap sound was the sound of my femur breaking as I rolled around on the gravel hillside clenching my foot (I am tearing up just writing this section). After a decade of holding up my extremely powerful masculine body, my poor left Croc finally threw in the towel and snapped under the pressure. I even held a ceremony for them beside the SUV, took pictures and stared back at them longingly in the rearview mirror as we drove away (Katie with a look of pure glee the whole time). Either way, it was finally time to buy a new pair. I will not say the word “replace” as nothing could ever replace those glorious yellow rubbery bundles of joy. That long story was just the lead up and actually has no relation to the reaction the store clerk had towards Isla. </p>

                    <p class="text-faded">We arrived at a shoe store in New Minas which Katie recommended due to their availability of Birkenstocks (you would think she was commissioned by that company due to her pushiness for the brand). I am sure they are wonderful sandals, but I did not get any because they look like a pair of corks strapped to your feet. As we entered the store we were greeted by two older ladies working at the time. One obviously mentioned how beautiful Isla was and said she would be with us in a moment. I made the mistake of walking towards the other saleslady in the back of the store. She quickly pointed out that she noticed our baby was a little yellow. Just a note to all of you out their who haven’t had a jaundice baby: this is not the way you want to start a conversation with a parent of a yellow baby. Usually the socially adept people at this moment notice my annoyed look on my ginger face or avoidant speak, but this lady clearly did not. She continued questioning me, like I was under arrest, in regards to our apparently unbelievably yellow baby. The conversation went as follows: </p>
                    
                    <blockquote>Me: “Yes, I noticed that as well. It must be due to this rare liver disease which she has been inflicted with.”</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>Floofy Saleslady: “Oh dear, that’s horrible, was she born with it?”</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>sidenote: Everytime I hear someone say “is she born with it?” I can’t help but sing in my head “maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s MAYBELLINE!”</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>Me: “Yes.”</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>Floof: “Is she going to need surgery?”</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>Me: “Yes.”</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>Me: “Hey Isla, whaddaya say, should Daddy head over to the wall now and look at some sandals?” While I edged away from the nosey lady looking for a topic for her next tea party with her “well-to-do” lady friends.</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>Floof: muttering more incoherent questions behind me as I walked away.</blockquote>

                    <p class="text-faded">I was in the middle of trying on some sandals and I turned to notice the lady had now cornered Katie and was quizzing her on Isla’s disease. I began wondering if she had been recently accepted into medical school and had many questions for an upcoming exam. That had to be the only explanation for her relentlessness, but it turns out there are just “silly” people out there in the world (Katie made me censor the actual adjective I used for the sales lady). Needless to say, I actually found a pair of moderately comfy thong sandals made of suede and rubber (not quite my old bumble bees, but they look nice and they’ll do).</p>
                    
                    <h2>Splish Splash</h2>
                    
                    <p class="text-faded">Katie and I have heard a few horror stories now of parents trying to coax their children into swimming. It seems like for some children it is like you are asking them to eat a handful of liver covered broccoli while giving them a noogie. Clearly we did not want to experience this so Katie took right to Dr. Googlé and figured out how early we could put Isla into swimming lessons. Who knows if it’ll work or not, but it should be fun at the very least. Turns out as soon as your child hits two months Acadia Athletics department will teach them how to swim (the most expensive University in Nova Scotia must be desperate). </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-faded">We made it to two swimming lessons before the big trip to Toronto (stay tuned for this much anticipated story). During the second lesson we headed through the front doors of the athletic department, past the hungover girl at the front desk (who I am pretty sure we woke up), and to the family changing room. Again, people gawking at our pretty little lady along the way (or maybe they were wondering why she had such a golden tan, who knows now?!). It became clear that Isla was definitely the youngest and smallest child at the pool. Our class consisted of Isla, myself, the instructor, and two other ladies with their boys. I, being the jerk I am, immediately started stacking the two boys up against Isla. They were both much older and one, in particular, was actually held back a class because he cried when his face got wet. They were both cool little dudes though and did very well, but Isla showed them both up. I advised the instructor that Isla had been working on her backstroke and she had a solid butterfly, but they all started laughing like I was joking… On a serious note, the instructor did very well with the tools she was given. The lessons mainly consisted of the two mothers and I gliding our children on the surface of the pool water. We floated rubber balls and rubber duckies to the kids and watched them bounce off of their stupefied faces, thinking they would actually pick them up and start playing catch with them. I began to feel bad for the instructor, like she drew the short straw and was stuck with all of the floppy, bundles of flubby baby skin, which lacked proper head control. I do have to say though, I learned something from the instructor as she put an honourable effort into her lessons. She had mentioned to start early with splashing Isla with a modest amount of water on the face because that is usually what generates the fears later on in life. To this day, Isla gets face splashes from her sadistic parents anytime she comes into contact with water. Isla was a great sport about it during each lesson, though. She never once cried and essentially kept a straight faced death stare the whole time as she clung to me (obviously I didn’t mind my pride and joy clinging to her protector). She takes after her mother with this “look” though. </p>
                    
                    <hr class="light" style="width:50%;">

                    <hr class="light" style="width:50%;">
                    
                    <p class="text-faded">She would have probably stayed in the pool all day, but I ended up calling it quits when she started shivering and acquiring some purple lips. I would thank the instructor and we would head back to the changing rooms. </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-faded">On this particular day Katie was sitting on the side benches by the pool with the other parents. I was too busy to notice, but I guess during the lessons Katie experienced another aspiring medical professional (not really, it was an Acadia employee). She was heading from parent to parent to let them know that they were no longer allowed to sit on the sidelines because it was too distracting for the kids. They would have to sit up a floor behind some glass walls to watch. Before she got to Katie she had mentioned the rule to another parent. That parent had advised the employee that she would not be partaking in the seating arrangement due to her child having Cystic Fibrosis and would need her close by incase anything went wrong. The employees’ response to this was to ask the mother how their child was doing now, to which the mother politely answered: “she’s doing fine at this moment.” I can picture Katie’s anticipation now building after overhearing this conversation. After a few moments of tense conversation with the other mother, the overly bubbly employee advised Katie of the new seating arrangements. I guess at this time she asked which one (which child) belonged to Katie in the pool. I would have been a smart ass and pointed to me, but Katie is a much more decent person and pointed to Isla. You guessed it, the lady advised Katie that our baby was yellow like we were some colour blind morons. Again, I would have responded by saying: </p>
                    
                    <blockquote>“Well I’ll beef hooked, that is a yellow baby. Must be the tanning beds we have been bringing her to.”</blockquote>
                    
                    <p class="text-faded">but Katie being the lovely, but now annoyed person she is, responded by saying: </p>
                    
                    <blockquote>“Yes, she has a liver disease and will need a transplant.” </blockquote>
                    
                    <p class="text-faded">Hoping that her bluntness would turn the woman off from a full on diarrhea of judgements and questions. Oh no, she wasn’t done being nosey and eventually very rude. Have you ever experienced those people who realize what they are saying is not going to fly, but they keep flapping their gums and digging a bigger hole instead of just shutting up and moving on? Well she was one of them and ten-fold.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-faded">The ensuing conversation went as follows: </p>
                    
                    <blockquote>Gum Flapper: “Oh… What’s the prognosis of that?”</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>I imagine saying, in retrospect: “Not good, this will actually be the last swimming lesson for her, but it was setup by “Make a Wish.” (I know dick thing to say, but this lady was appalling and this story won’t even do it justice. She deserved to be shut down quickly even though saying even that probably would not have stopped her.</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>Much nicer Katie: “...” red-faced and visibly annoyed.</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>Gum Flapper: (while walking away): “Oh well if I could I’d give her my liver.” She 	said in a overly phoney tone.</blockquote>
                    
                    <p class="text-faded">Luckily, this instance, the goof wasn’t as relentless as the sandal saleslady. Needless to say, some people have no idea how to react to something out of the ordinary, which is fine and expected. The problem is those people need to be a little more courteous and just smile and pass by. It does give me good blog material though so thank you silly people. An example of proper handling was a kind lady at the Scott’s Bay beach. She walked up to us to tell us how beautiful our little girl was. She “asked” if she was a little yellow in contrast to putting out a public bulletin to us. We said yes, to which she simply said: “well it’s good she’s out getting some sun, I hear it’s good for that.” She paused a little bit to assess the conversation and quickly mentioned that she was getting a grandchild soon and wished us a good day. As my old grade nine math teacher so eloquently put it: “use the KISS principle people, you know, keep it simple stupid.”</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-faded">On a side note: I wonder how the employee has fared, because that day WAS the last swimming lesson we attended. Thankfully not for the horrible reason to which I picked fun at, but because we were soon headed to Toronto to get Isla assessed for transplant.</p>

                                    <p>So here we are. It is Monday April 11th (5 days before Katie's 28th birthday. Had to say that in this post as she never remembers her age and it is scary). It will be Isla's third trip to see her paediatrician. This Thursday will be her zillionth time seeing her GI specialist and blood clinic (I know, zillion is an exaggeration, but it's been a lot). The thing is, am I going to tell you why? Of course not! You will have to read on punk! Oooohhh, bomb drop, no he didn't? Yes he did! Title drop... I digress.</p>

                                    <p>Let's start over. We left off with Katie spitting out a baby human from her Hoo Hah. Why not start there? We are now in the maternity unit at the Valley Regional Hospital and being treated like royalty for some reason (maybe it's because Katie is the big bad boss lady and scares the crap out of everyone? Maybe not...). Everything is going fairly smooth.  I mean, those fuckers don't sleep, but other than that everything is swell. We had regular visits from the paediatrician (not the one mentioned above, but the hospital one. I'll do my best to keep things straight for ya over the next couple of posts (there are a lot of professionals so keep up!). I know their job is important and all, but it seems the gist of what they do is come into your room while you are stress ridden and lacking sleep. Next, they mosey on over to your FINALLY sleeping baby, whip off their onesie, start poking at their bellies, rotating their legs ever so slightly, wake the damn baby up, and then leave the room with an evil chuckle. I'm just kidding, they're great. Isla had frequent visits from nurses and blood collection. She got her little heel poked and squeezed in order to check a battery of different things. She took that poke like a champ, too. That's important to me, because I'm the biggest pansy around when it comes to needles. I can handle blood, several broken bones, ruptured appendix, etc, but when that little sliver of metal pierces my body, this 6' 3" lug collapses like a ton of bricks. Yes I know, I'm a big baby. There's feeble little old ladies that go in on a regular basis whom are so cool with those torture devices that they almost take it from the technician’s hand and poke themselves. I had to have at least one flaw yah know!</p>

                                    <p>It's amazing how long you can just stare at this wondrous creation of yours. I'm serious, MGM or Fox needs to jump on this opportunity and make a movie/time-lapse video of some random baby being a baby. That shit would be a hit!! We were in the hospital for two days. These two days felt a lot longer due to our sleeping arrangements. When you're sleeping on a rickety old cot made for a little person and a blanket that's basically the size of a bath towel; it ain’t fun. It was all worth it in the end, though, or at least we kept telling ourselves that... Flash forward to an extremely sleepless night during the first week we brought Isla home. She was fussy as all hell and we were at our wits end with ways to settle her. Both of us were sitting down, hair standing at its ends, panting, and Katie looks up at me to say: "I can't do this anymore." (by the way, Katie is someone who needs all of her sleep in order to function properly so you can imagine the shape she was in). I stood up and abruptly said: "Alright, pack up her things, let's give her back!" That's basically my role in our relationship and it has been working quite well for the last 12 years. When Katie is being a drama queen, I say something stupid to lighten the mood.</p>

                                    <p>Flash back again to a few days prior to the day we were ready to enforce the return policy on Isla. We were at the hospital for our final day, full of anticipation to get the "all clear" for her routine tests and head home. Everything is how it should be. She is responsive, her belly pokes reveal normality, and she even had that disgusting amniotic poop (the one that looks like molasses (knew there was a reason I didn't trust molasses). The only concern they had was her bilirubin levels were on the high side of normal (hence the extra day at the hospital). For those of you who don’t know, bilirubin is the active part of your bile, which is secreted from your liver and into your small intestine. It’s main function is the break down of red blood cells and digestion of fat in your diet (by no means is that the medical definition, but it is my understanding. There will be more layman's definitions to come as we have had many’a learnings over the last few months). That's fairly normal though and even if her levels didn't drop they would just give her her first trip to the tanning bed and say goodbye to her newborn jaundice. Long story short, the bilirubin levels did drop and we were released that day. We bundled her up in her car seat like an easily bruised kiwi, carried her out to the SUV like she would shatter if dropped, and headed home to our new normal!</p>

                                    <p>We learned that at a few days old Isla was definitely a princess. When putting her down for a nap she needed the following: tightly wrapped swaddle blanket (see my "must haves” section below, they are freakin' awesome and fairly priced), a perfect temperature of 26 to 28 degrees Celsius, near pitch black room, and constant white noise (also in my “must haves” section). If any of those variables are missing you can pretty much kiss your sleep goodbye. Katie's genes definitely kicked the shit out of my rare Ginger Genes. Luckily Isla got her mothers deep brown eyes, darker complexion, brown hair (what little of it she has), and a mini-me face of her mother. Come to think of it, if it wasn't for how long that baby was, I would have bene looking for a paternity test. Either Katie hooked up with the Purolator man or Isla just asexually budded off of her mother.</p>

                                    <p>Katie had researched just about everything baby related prior to Isla's arrival. She even looked up a very descriptive  and picturesque step by step guide to how poop colour/texture should look at all stages of a babies' life (I thought it was gross, but I have learned now how important this is, so make sure you know your babies' poop!). We were a little over a month in and starting to get into a good routine with our baby girl. The first two weeks were a shit show, but it's surprising how innately parenting is just picked up. So all of you soon-to-be parents out there, take it from me, things will work out just fine. We were starting to have some concerns however. Isla's jaundice wasn't decreasing in her skin and the sclera of her eyes (that’s the white part of your eyes). Her poop wasn't the bright yellow colour we were expecting, but was in fact quite pale-grey. She wasn't gaining weight as quickly as the baby growth chart was expecting (parents, make sure you are keeping an eye on all of these milestones of a newborn. Parents will always know best, but you need to do a little research with the guidance of your doctor). The lack of growth was a tough one as Katie and I believed strongly in the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding, but unfortunately had to make the compromise of supplementing with formula. We still didn't go exclusively to formula, which I thought was a good compromise. It seemed that Isla agreed as well, since it helped her growth get back on track and even helped her sleep longer at night. Because breastfeeding jaundice is quite common and she was back to normal growth, our family doctor wasn't too concerned with Isla's progression. Thank god Katie was so obsessed with Isla's poop as you will soon understand! As soon as that waft of pleasant odor reached Katie's nose (from up to a mile away), you would hear her feet drop to the floor and she would run towards me to tackle the diaper out of my hand for inspection. If it wasn't for the poop inspection, our family doctor never would have referred us to a local paediatrician (who goes above and beyond any health professional I've ever met. Amazing dude), and we never would have made it to our newest normal with Isla.</p>

                                    <p>Ok, I'm finally going to tell you. Hopefully the suspense is unbearable now for you, my lovely readers, who do not know our family personally (I know, leading you on like this was a dick move, but we have made it). It was mid December 2015. Isla was just over a month old. I was working in the city and Katie was in the midst of her 4 months maternity leave (we decided I'd take the remaining 8 months, hence the term Fommy. Best decision of my life). It was the day Katie brought Isla in to see her paediatrician. It was about 6:30 pm when I got home from work and Katie had waited for me to arrive home before telling me how the doctor’s visit went. I remember walking in the door and seeing Katie holding our sweet baby girl tightly with tears in her eyes. She said the meeting did not go so well. Our whole lives we have been extremely fortunate so I always assume the best outcome, which makes it that much harder to hear bad news for once. However, we knew someday it was bound to happen. The paediatrician agreed that the jaundice and pale coloured poop was concerning. He advised Katie to head to the Valley Regional Hospital that day and get blood work done. He told us that there could be several reasons for these symptoms, but he wanted to rule out the most serious one, which is a dandy little disease called Biliary Atresia. This is where we learned that our paediatrician was a god send and he takes his career to a whole new level of awesomeness. He called Katie after hours to share with her the abnormal blood results and he called multiple times afterwards to ensure we were doing ok as well as having all of our questions answered. Our doctor presumed, with the risk of Biliary Atresia, that we would be admitted into the IWK Children's Hospital in Halifax. Unfortunately, he was correct and we took a trip to the hospital a couple days after the blood was drawn.</p>

                                    <p>You will soon see that our little Bambino is one tough SOB and she was damn good at getting me off work, un-planned (arriving a week early and now with a potential health issue). I would prefer to get off work for other reasons, but thank you dear. The holidays were now creeping up, we had just been admitted to the IWK (the bomb hasn't been dropped yet), and we don't even realize how our lives will change, yet again.</p>

                                    <p>The nail-biting day had arrived. The day we were to find out if our precious little peanut was just messing with us or about to change our lives. We had packed for about a week and had hoped it would not be any longer than that. Usually having most of our close friends living in Halifax (1.5 hours away from home) was inconvenient unless we needed a place to crawl back to after a night of “apple juice” drinking, however, this trip it was a god-send. Especially my best bud’s wife, Cindy. They lived about a 10 minute walk from the IWK and they went above and beyond during our stay at the hospital. They offered a room in their house for us to stay, if needed, and Cindy checked in on us almost everyday. Katie and I dropped off all of our luggage at the Snillis’ (name changed in order to protect their identity) and headed to the hospital to get Isla admitted. Who would have known Isla’s first big outing would be to the IWK, how exciting… </p>

                                    <p>First thing’s first: we headed on down to the first floor of the hospital to get Isla setup for her ultrasound. They wanted to get a look at her liver and other organs as a first measure diagnostic. Isla loved the ultrasound (as evidenced by her sleeping through the entire exam)… well probably not the ultrasound rather the dimly lit room with the soothing hum of the machine fan as well as the warm blanket placed over her (at times, even I was tempted to sleep, but I guess that would be frowned upon being a respectful adult and all). Katie and I were looking intently at the screen in which the ultrasound technician kept flying through different images, snapping pictures as well as sound clips. I don’t know what Katie and I were expecting to see, because to the untrained eye it just looked like a bunch of gobble-y-gook. After about an hour, give or take, the technician finished everything she had to do and went to get the doctor for a final look. When the doctor came in the room both her and the technician brought up a specific area of Isla’s insides back onto the screen. They seemed puzzled and were having a hard time finding her gall bladder. At this time, all we knew was this could be a problem or it could be normal, due to the gall bladder being about the size of a piece of dandruff on a 1 month old. One diagnostic test complete, that wasn’t so bad, now on to patient admittance.</p>

                                    <p>Isla was admitted to the IWK hospital mid-December. At just over a month old, that means both of her parents were admitted as well. There was no way I would be spending any time away from my baby girl while she was in the hospital. Work was being very accommodating and they had allowed me to take as much time as I needed before coming back. We headed up to the 7th floor (paediatric unit) to get setup with our accommodations and I headed back to the Snillis’ house to pick up our things. Here I was, in the freezing cold, walking up University Avenue dragging an oversized luggage bag, diaper bag wrapped around one shoulder, another bag draped over the luggage bag, and the u-shaped breast feeding pillow around my neck like those pillows on an air plane (or as I liked to call it: “the flower-patterned hemorrhoid pillow). Why was everyone giving me funny looks? Who knows? When I had arrived back to the hospital Katie and Isla were all settled in and a lovely Gastrointestinal (GI) resident was poking at her belly (Isla’s belly that is). The resident had finished her examination and advised us to get comfortable while we waited for the GI specialist, Dr. R. When Dr. R and the resident arrived, Isla was content in her crib (or space-ship cage, those hospital cribs are intense!). Dr. R went right to the belly poking and I remember the resident saying how interesting it was that all babies, no matter what part of the world you are in, make the same sounds and gestures (I remember thinking: “that is neat.”). After the examination was complete, Dr. R wanted us to sit down and give him our full attention. He was an older doctor with a grey and white speckled beard to which he claimed babies enjoyed due to its resemblance to Santa Claus. Dr. R went right to the explanation of Biliary Atresia and advised us, that with Isla’s symptoms as well as the ultrasound results, he was about 95% sure it was what she had. This news took the wind right from our sails (or shall I say it was a “bomb drop?”) as it was the first time we had a doctor as certain as this. We kept our cool though and listened to him while he drew his, Picasso of a drawing, of the liver-GI tract.</p>

                                    <p>I am now going to explain, in my understanding, what Biliary Atresia is so if you do not want to be schooled please skip through the rest of this paragraph. However, it will be important to understand as we progress through Isla’s life-story… hint, hint, wink, wink. Biliary Atresia is the blockage or absence of liver bile ducts and it impacts approximately 1 in 15K to 20K newborns in North America (fairly rare and not the odds you want to win). They have yet to determine a cause. The bile duct’s job is to secrete bile into our small intestines where it’s job is to assist with the digestion of fat as well as excretion of bilirubin (by-product of recycled red blood cells in the liver as well as turning an adult’s poop brown). Now the problem with this disease is that the bile ducts of the liver as well as the main bile duct outside the liver are damaged or blocked. When these ducts are blocked the bile has a hard time leaving the liver and entering the gut. The bile builds up in the liver and can cause serious damage or cirrhosis (liver tissue replaced with scar tissue) and the damage can be fatal. The procedure they do to correct the atresia is called the Kasai procedure. In this procedure they dissect the diseased bile ducts in the liver, remove the main bile duct, remove the gall bladder, determine where the liver is draining the most bile, and connect the small intestine directly to that part of the liver (pretty big surgery for such a little thing). This procedure corrects the atresia (or blockage), but it does not stop the progression of the disease in about 95% of cases. It is not a perfect solution and the bile still builds up in the liver causing damage over time. The main objective of the procedure is to tie the child over until they are older and can support a liver transplant more effectively. Essentially, this is what was explained to us by Dr. R and his diagram as well as our own personal research (take what you read online with a grain of salt, though).</p>

                                    <p>Whoa! If you think that was a lot to take in, try listening to that in real life and try learning that your beautiful little lady could potentially have this disease. Dr. R was very good with his explanation as well as making sure we fully understood. We both nodded, both doctors left the room, and then came the waterworks. We both just let the emotions out. We cried, we held each other, we swore to the high heavens, and kept asking why? Being well versed in the woes of healthcare, we are always frustrated by how much people abuse the gift of health. Smoking, excessive drinking, hard drugs, eating crap, and not exercising to name a few. Most adults that get admitted into the hospital are not innocent in their ailments, some do very little to prevent them from happening and literally suck the life out of the “free” healthcare system we benefit from. Then we have a sweet and innocent new life brought into the world plagued with a disease; it’s not fair. It was one of the hardest pills to swallow, being first time parents and all. It is scary enough having a newborn with all of the unknowns, fears, excitement, and joy, but add a disease into that mix and you are playing a whole new ball game. Thank god I have had my amazing wife by my side for so long and knowing that this is just one more challenge in our relationship. We always face everything head on and together and we were determined that this would not end that. Once we vented and got through that sudden blow, we gathered ourselves and put our guard back up. We knew this was going to be a long trip to the hospital and we would have to be strong for everyone. I mean, who wants a room full of adults hysterically crying? That wouldn’t help anyone. At this point, we knew that there was definitely something wrong with our baby girl, not necessarily Biliary Atresia but definitely something. The rest of the week was dedicated to getting to the bottom of what was causing her jaundice and pale poop. Thank god babies are very resilient, too bad daddy isn’t so much</p>

                                    <hr>

                                    <p>Our first week started out with a bang. Katie and I had come to terms with the fact that Isla most likely had Biliary Atresia, but there was still a little hope in the back of our minds that she might still be fucking with us (too bad it wasn’t April fools). Our mornings began with wake up sessions from the blood lab. Isla, the tough cookie, did not really mind the little poke on the bottom of her heel. What she did mind was the restraint caused by one of the technicians holding her leg straight as the other quickly scraped blood into a test tube, drop by drop (the girl just liked to move it, move it!).</p>

                                    <p>One of us would then sneak out to the kitchen with our pre-mixed formula and disposable baby bottle, heat some water in the microwave for the formula, and quickly creep back to the room to feed our baby girl. We would then order some breakfast from “Dial-for-Dining,” shit, shower, shave, and prepare for our day. Dial for Dining, by the way, was the food service setup the IWK had where you would choose an appetizer, entree, two drinks and a desert all for the price of $10. The food was all pretty good, unlike times I have stayed in the hospital choking back a cold bagel and some Jell-O. The food was ordered via the cafeteria and hand delivered right to our room. I still dream of the mango frozen yoghurt… Besides all of the tests, our days carried out very similarly: blood test, Dial for Dining time, eat the enormous amount of food provided by friends and family (thanks mom, Tabitha’s mom Michelle, Dad, etc), colour in adult colouring books with friends, telling Vanessa how awesome she was for house-sitting (seriously, she cleaned the cat litter, ran the dishwasher, fed our three cats, and took pictures of them for us; she was their new mother), and sleep in our single hospital bed (if we didn’t hold on to each other, one of us was bound to fall off).</p>

                                    <p>One day we had a short older nurse with spiked dark hair (who quickly became one of our favourite nurses) introduce us to an amazing little sugar solution called “toot-sweet.” For those of you who do not know, this clear sugar-liquid contained in a small purple tube, was named “baby crack” on the paediatric floor. You could be giving your baby a “Horse Bite” while dunking her head into the toilet for a swirly and as long as a drop of this liquid touched her lips, she would probably be giggling the whole time. Seriously though, the mornings became a lot easier with this shit. Instead of two technicians standing over our daughter grabbing and poking while we sat on our bed red eyed and glaring; it would be two technicians as well one of us squeezing one drop at a time of Toot-Sweet as soon as Isla’s eyebrow so much as twitched. Isla could be mid-screech and as soon as the drop touched her lips she would immediately stop, start slurping like a pudgy toddler with a popsicle on a scorching hot day, and moan with each suck as though to say: “it’s so good, once it hits your lips, it’s so good!” Needless to say, this shit was da-bomb and was used several more times during our stay..</p>

                                    <p>We felt as though we met with every professional at the IWK including the kitchen sink. Everyone wanted their piece of the pie with Isla and for the most part they were necessary. We met with all of the Gastrointestinal (GI) specialists including Dr. R’s two other colleagues, the awkwardly quiet resident, and a plethora of medical students. Katie and I quickly became the experts on Biliary Atresia and had to sometimes explain it to the IWK professionals since it was such a rare disease (Dr. R claimed that they only receive 1-2 cases a year in the Maritimes). There was nutritionist who setup Isla with her special formula concentration as well as vitamin regimen. There was a social worker who checked in to see how we were coping with everything. There was the genetics team who created a pedigree as well as going over Isla’s diagnostic plan for their branch of medicine (which turns out, was the bulk of her diagnostic work). This was quite the situation and Katie and I learned more than we wanted to about our families. Luckily My mom as well as Katie’s mom were both in the room and they had a better grasp of our family disease history. “Great uncle Jib fell off a ladder when he was trying to peep on his neighbour and ever since he has a permanent erection,” said my mom. Katie’s mom said, “Cousin Beedoowapdo from Zambia got herpes from his pet Orangutan, but they are still in love.” I am surprised the poor geneticist stuck around as long as she did, however pale her skin turned. The genetics team was trying to rule out a disorder called Alagille syndrome, which can cause fewer than normal bile ducts in the liver, amongst many other things. The doctors understandably wanted to be 100% sure Isla’s condition was Biliary Atresia before performing the surgery.</p>

                                    <h2>Diagnostic Week</h2>

                                    <p>I will summarize her diagnostics test for the first ten days of our stay in the following paragraph. The first stop of the week was x-ray. We headed down to the x-ray room where we were met with an exceptionally bubbly x-ray technician. We got to put on the bullet-proof vests and hold Isla straight out with her arms up and legs down (she clearly did not enjoy this). They wanted to have a look at her spine since Alagille can cause an abnormal curvature in the spine. Next, we headed to the ophthalmologist (eye doctor) to check her eyes. During this test the eye doctor was checking for common Alagille indicators such as iris and optic disc issues. This was the first test where the doctor essentially took a quick glance and said there was nothing wrong (one step closer to a complete diagnosis of Biliary Atresia). The next test was the sweat test. This one was an interesting one to me. It was clear the technology has not changed in decades. The nurse rubbed a cream on Isla’s leg, hooked her up to an electrode machine, and wrapped her leg (with electrode attached) in a bag. The electrode caused her to sweat, the sweat was then captured by the bag, and the sample was sent off to test whether she was at risk for Cystic Fibrosis or not. The final piece of the genetics diagnostic puzzle was to perform an echo of Isla’s heart (ultrasound of the heart). This test was the second time we received confirmation from the nurse/technician that Isla was not at risk for Alagille (It’s also when I started wondering why we had to do so many damn genetics tests including the following blood draw). Part way through the test the nurse was looking closely at Isla’s heart and simply said: “These are textbook images, I could use them to teach a class on the anatomy of the heart.” At the end of the echo, Katie and I had come to terms with the likeliness of Isla needing surgery for Biliary Atresia. It was great that she did not have some extremely rare genetic disorder, but was still a chronic disease nonetheless, which was going to change her life. No matter where we were in the hospital, be it walking through the halls, in x-ray, blood lab, ultrasound, or paediatric unit, people always went out of their way to let us know how beautiful our little lady was. They were always astonished at how well behaved she was and shocked when we told them what we were at the hospital for (she did not look like a sickly baby, maybe a little yellow, but not sickly). Of course, Katie and I already knew how awesome our bambino was and always obliged with a gracious thank you.</p>

                                    <h2>Finalizing Diagnosis</h2>

                                    <p>After the wondrous week of test after test, we met with the GI team as well as the surgery team to go over what to expect. They advised us of the good news that Isla was healthy in every way besides her liver function. They were all on the same page now and wanted to advise us of what to expect with surgery (the Kasai procedure would be performed (see last post for explanation) as well as a biopsy of liver tissue to see the extent of damage). At this time, Isla’s name was making its rounds around the hospital. Katie’s friend Tabitha works as a nurse in the operating room so the surgical team was forewarned of the awesomeness which was Isla. Even so, they were blown away by her cuteness and quickly took a liking to our little munchkin. The surgery team was made up of several nurses, a resident, an anesthesiologist, and four surgical doctors (Dr. Superstar (performed the surgery), Dr. M, Dr, D and the surgical fellow, Dr. Victoria (who was nothing short of a great person)). The surgery team assured us that we would have the A-team, but they were not sure which one of them was going to perform the surgery as it was getting closer to Christmas and the schedule was out of whack. We had one more test to do in order to finalize the need of surgery and that was the HIDA scan. Isla had been taking a crap-ton of a red coloured liquid all week in order to dilate her liver vessels for the HIDA scan (Phenobarbital). It was the end of the week and we headed down to see the nuclear medicine team for Isla’s scan. They would be performing it once today and once more a day later in order to get clear results. We brought Isla into the room and set her up on, what looked like, an MRI machine. They had to administer a radioactive dye via intravenous so that the machine could pickup the tree-like structure of her liver vessels. The whole point of this test was to see if and how well Isla’s bile was moving through her liver and into her gut. Besides the stubborn team jabbing Isla multiple times in order to administer the dye (then settling on sticking the needle in a vein of her head), the test was fairly straight forward. However, seeing my sweet little girl stabbed by a needle on each of her appendages made me so upset I had to leave the room. As we were looking at the screen, which was pretty neat, neither one of us thought that we could see drainage into her gut. This was confirmed early the next day when we met with the surgery team again and they advised us that they would be performing surgery on Isla. One more official blow to our nerves, but this time we were prepared.</p>

                                    <h2>Pre-Surgery</h2>

                                    <p>It was finally official, after the grueling tens days of diagnosis, that Isla certainly had Biliary Atresia (of course not 110% sure until she was opened up, but 99.9% repeating). We found comfort in the amazing surgery team and Tabitha assured us, now that we knew who was performing the surgery, that Dr. Superstar was the best person to do it. Dr. Superstar had spoken with us about how Biliary Atresia, however un-ideal it was, was the best of the worst things for Isla to have. Firstly, babies are very resilient and the liver is especially so. The liver is one of the only organs that regenerates (thankfully for all of you alcohol abusers out there) and only needs to have a blood type match in order to donate a live piece of liver. Secondly, The Kasai procedure is not a permanent fix for 95% of all patients, but the goal is to prolong the time needed before the child needs a transplant (gives the child time to grow before partaking in a major surgery). Thirdly, Dr, Superstar was the only doctor on the surgical team who had performed the surgery before, so he was the right man for the job. These facts shed some light on Katie and my concerns and I am pretty sure we both decided, right then and there, that we would both be volunteering to be her liver donor. This would mean that we would have to slightly tweak our lifestyle: drastically cutting back on alcohol consumption, lowering our BMI’s, and continuing to stay focused on a healthy living/eating plan. We already actively pursued these goals, but raising Isla under these conditions so that she can make healthy choices herself, was the final kick in the pants for Katie and I. The surgery was booked for the 22<sup>nd</sup> of December and other than being at home, we learned that the IWK was an amazing place to be for Christmas.</p>

                                    <h2>Surgery</h2>

                                    <p>The day had arrived, and saying that Katie and I were on edge was an understatement. Luckily Katie’s good friend, Tabitha, volunteered to be with us when we handed Isla over to the surgery team. Since we were headed to Tabitha’s place of work, we had no problem navigating the hospital to where we needed to go. Of course, when we arrived at the waiting room all of Tabitha’s co-workers needed to see the famous Isla and it was nice to see how great the staff was in whom we were entrusting our babies’ wellbeing to. I will never forget the final moments before the team took her into surgery. The anesthesiologist had come out to explain the procedure, but I did not hear a word he said, I was just nodding and going through the motions. I had my sweet baby girl in my arms, Tabitha, Katie and I had all kissed her “good-luck.” Then the younger nurse, must not have seen me kiss Isla, and said: “daddy has to kiss his little girl.” I kissed her, longer this time, said I loved her, looked up and saw the whole nursing team was crying as well, and that was it for me. I don’t think I have ever cried so much in my life, the cliche tough guy in me could no longer hold back. It was official, Isla had broken down my tough exterior and I would forever have a soft spot in my heart for her. The only other thought I had besides Isla was: “this poor innocent lady who just so happened to hit the button in the elevator to the surgery floor, only to have the doors open up to Katie, Tabitha, and I holding each other in this state.” We gathered our composure as we headed up the elevator back to the 7th floor where both of our families were waiting. We quickly gathered our things and moved to the surgical unit, which is where Isla would be heading after her surgery. </p>

                                    <p>That night everyone convinced me to finally leave the hospital, since I could not be by Isla’s side in surgery, and we stayed at the Snillis’ house. Watching some movies, having a beer and sleeping in their comfortable bed (a straw bed would be desirable after two weeks in a single and cot) was much needed. Besides Katie and I jumping and staring at each other intently each time a phone or microwave beeped, it was a pretty straightforward evening. Dr. Superstar had promised to have his staff inform us periodically of surgery updates, which were all: “progressing well.” Finally the final update came from Dr. Superstar himself who called to let us know the surgery went well and that he was ready to meet with us to go over post surgery expectations as well as to see how we were doing. The post surgery recovery stretched through Isla’s first Christmas, but I will talk about this in more detail in my next post. I promise, it will all be good news and then we can get back to the crazy-silly day-to-day shenanigans of Isla and her family!</p>

                                    <h2>Recovery Week</h2>

                                    <p>We all survived the surgery. Isla had about a week of recovery on the surgical unit of the IWK Hospital. The rooms on this unit were much bigger. I'd say they were the Hilton to the Holiday Inn of the Paediatric unit. It was definitely hard to see our baby girl all doped up with an IV, nasogastric tube (NG) coming out of her nose and a pulse monitor connected to her toe. That damn monitor was a pain in the ass, too. If it moved one nanometer, from one of her toe hairs to the other, alarms would sound and wake up the neighbourhood. Katie and I were good "parents of a patient," too. We were on the ball with keeping track of her poops/pees, feedings and medicine intake before surgery. However, right after surgery we unfortunately had a little break from this due to the IV and nasogastric tube. While these two things were in we were no longer needed for feeding Isla or providing medicine as this was all done via the IV. In addition, the nasogastric tube was in place to suck out all of the crap from her stomach. Our lively little "ham" of a daughter was now quite lethargic, which was the toughest thing for me to see. We were all waiting on the glorious FART. The fart was the sign that she could have the NG tube taken out and we could begin feeding her again. I never thought I would be in such anticipation of flatulence in my life. Luckily, Isla was in a hurry as well, since no more than two days post-surgery (December 23rd, 2015) that puff of methane from her cute little buttocks emerged. Confetti fell from the ceilings, a choir sang in the background and horns blew throughout the floor. “Isla has passed gas!” The town crier proclaimed… Our charting began immediately with the first report being...</p>

                                    <p>There weren't many more eventful moments after "the bum burp." She went back to breast feeding and formula. A couple days later the pain medications were weaned off as Isla’s mother and I remained vigilant. It's hard enough to measure pain in a speaking adult let alone a two month old, but we got good at determining what certain cries and demeanour meant now. In case you haven't been paying attention, we ended up spending Christmas at the hospital. To end off the "post surgery" story I will explain two things (out of many) that the IWK provided, which blew Katie and I away. There is a Ronald McDonald house built into the hospital on the third floor. They periodically put on events such as: dinners, decorating, gift wrapping, etc. On Christmas Day they put on an extra special surprise, in collaboration with McKelvies, where they served the traditional Christmas dinner. It was all very delicious with tender turkey, stuffing, potatoes, gravy, etc. The second thing was the "gift room." If I was a kid (don't even start, Katie!) and happened to stumble across this room, I would be sharting in my batman shorts while crying with excitement. The room was FULL of presents from floor to ceiling, ranging from puzzles to full princess Elsa costumes. Being parents of a patient, we were allowed to pick out two large items, a onesie, some books, and wrap them up on the spot for Isla's surprise first Christmas (see main picture on last blog post to see the aftermath of her Christmas). Until this day I am still in awe of how far the community and IWK Foundation go in support of the hospital. Take it from me people; your donations go to the right place and are very much appreciated!</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>Heading Home</h2>

                                    <p>Although our stay was a gazzilion times longer than we expected, we were tickled fancy to be leaving on the 28th of December. Just under a month in the hospital, after little miss Isla only being alive for just over a month, and we were finally heading home... Phew!! Until this day (almost 6 months since Isla was born), we still don't quite know what normal is for our little bambino; we probably will never know. Before leaving the hospital, one of the things Dr. R advised us of was Isla's susceptibility to infection. She now had a dirty organ (intestine) attached directly to a clean organ (liver) so infection risk was higher for her than the average baby. Any time Isla has any symptoms of infection or a high temperature, we need to head into the hospital and get her setup for tests to rule out the common cold, flu, urinary tract infection, etc. If it is none of the usual ailments causing the higher temperature then it could be an infection of her surgery site called Cholangitis. Knowing our luck so far, what do you think happened after about a month back at home? Isla generated a temperature of over 38 degrees Celsius, which is concerning (keep this in mind "new parents"). Just like robots, Katie and I packed a bag, gathered ourselves and rushed to the hospital (about a minute away). I called the IWK prior to heading to our local hospital and the doctor-on-call immediately called the Valley Regional to inform them of our arrival. We were warned at the IWK that we would have to advocate for Isla’s condition when we headed into the ER with Isla having a fever. Due to her condition being so rare there would be a high chance of it being dismissed as the common cold as well as her father going to jail for slapping the dismissing doctor in the face. Thankfully this was not the case at the Valley Regional and her fever was taken very seriously. They ruled out all of the common issues which cause a fever and we headed to the IWK that night (1.5 hours away).</p>

                                    <p>Just one more learning experience in the life of Isla. We ended up staying at the IWK for a week while Isla was on IV antibiotics. Cholangitis is hard to diagnose and can be very detrimental to her surgery. Needless to say, they essentially just pumped her with a bunch of antibiotics for at least a week and monitored her symptoms. Not a whole lot happened during this trip besides the "poop explosion surprise."</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>The Poop Exlplosion Surprise</h2>

                                    <p>We went through the regular cycle of nurses and “dial for dining” again during our week long stay. There was one bubbly blond nurse who was exceptional this time and became one of our new favourites. She just understood us, was easy to talk to, and very considerate. I guess Isla had a different opinion of her, though. I always got a kick out of said nurse, because late at night she would do her best to tippy toe into our room, undo Isla's Velcro “Swaddle Me” blanket one Velcro ringlet at a time (see Amazon store below. These blankets are amazing if your baby likes to pull a Houdini and kick themselves free of all blankets in turn waking up the whole house with their tired screeches), and quickly silence the IV machine's beeping. Henceforth she will be called: “ninja nurse.” On this particular night our ninja nurse tried her best to check on Isla without a peep, but Isla wasn't having it. She screeched to the high heavens, and since Katie and I were experts on her cry-a-nese language now, we knew this was the "I just shit my pantaloons" cry. Katie quickly flipped over me on the single bed and landed on all fours in one foul swoop. She hustled over to the very apologetic ninja nurse, said: "no worries, kemosabe," and swapped out Isla's diaper. Problem was, during this somewhat smooth move (pun intended), ninja nurse was standing just a tad bit close to the crib. The poor nurse was actually standing right smack dab in the middle of the "blast radius." In the split second it took Katie to take one diaper off, say: "hot damn," and slap the clean diaper on; ninja nurse fell back in a slow motion reverse running-man. She was hit! Our small two month old, 10 pounder, released a heat-seeking, soft serve stream of shit in a three foot trajectory all over the nurse's scrubs. We all had a little laugh, Isla had a little fart, ninja nurse wrote down Isla's address for revenge, and we settled back to sleep on our two foot by three foot bed made for elves. The problem is, you can't get mad at something which can unleash such evil just to end it off with a face like...</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>Made it in One Piece</h2>

                                    <p>We made it through the infection scare. Five IV lines later and some of the best poop colours Isla has produced and we were on our way home; for the second time in one month. We have not been back to the hospital since, knock on wood, besides Isla's monthly checkups/blood collection at the GI clinic.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>What Next?</h2>

                                    <p>If you think the poop explosion was bad, you just wait to see what kinds of mischief our little ham has put her parents through, “post explosion.” We are close to Isla’s daddy being home all by his lonesome, Isla starts to develop more of a personality, the night of terror, and much much more. Stay tuned folks!</p>

                                    <p>Who said parenting was hard? That person is nuts! Just kidding, parenting can be tough, but again it is all about perspective. When you have a sick child it can be tricky to determine whether fussiness is due to their disease or if fussiness is due to normal baby things (teething, gas, etc). We are at the point now where the normal baby things are a breeze. I have seen first time parents jump at any sniffle with their babies and we have been so over that. When you have to be on guard for things like: blood in the stool, fever due to intestinal infection, jaundice worsening, rashes, excessive itching, fluid in the abdomen, loss of appetite, etc; a quick sniffle or whimper doesn’t phase you anymore. All of this doesn't mean we haven’t had our fair share of “hair pulling” moments caused by normal baby things throughout Isla’s first half of a year. </p>

                                    <h2>The Four Month Regression</h2>

                                    <p>“Man we have an easy baby.” “She can basically take care of herself.” Those were some of the common statements Katie and I used to make in the first few months of Isla’s life. In the grand scheme of things, that is still mainly the case, but we hit a little speed bump at four months. Leading up to four months Isla would cry if she was hungry, she would cry if she was poopy, and she would cry a little when she was sleepy. In fact, most of the time she would just pass out wherever she was or on whomever she was on when she got tired. I swear, she could be sleeping on a hungry shark in the middle of a bump’n rave concert. We soon realized that allowing her to dictate when she was sleeping (or not) was a huuuuge mistake. It was sometime in February, Katie and I were arriving home from a trip to Halifax (I will refer to Halifax as the “city” from now on. (Typing three less letters caters to my laziness so well). On this particular night, It was much later than Isla’s 6-7pm bedtime when we started the bedtime routine. The routine was as follows: heat up a bottle of milk, start running the bath water to a perfect temperature (we learned that the perfect temperature was reached when the first thing Isla did when her butt touched the water was to let the pee rip), plop Isla in the bath (plastic tub-like structure with a fabric ramp), dry her off in her Klu Klux Klan-like towel (essentially has a hood on it which raises to the notorious pointed top like that lovely group of outstanding citizens), baby massage (“It puts the lotion on it’s skin”), clean that stinky surprise off her bum, leg and back, feed her the bottle (feed her the "milk" from the bottle for all of you literal folks), read her a story (if it’s mom’s turn) or do a little dance with her (if it’s dad’s turn), wrap her like a mummy in her Swaddle Me blanket, turn on the mobile’s light and music, top it all off with a soother in the mouth. Is it just me or does everyone else automatically think of Maggie from The Simpsons as soon as their baby starts sucking on her soother or dumb-tit or pacifier or sookie; whatever the hell you call it? (I have grown fond of dumb-tit ever since I heard that name a few months back. I think it caters to my child-like sense of humour or as some people call it “immaturity”). Unfortunately, this night was different. Usually she lets off a long comforting sigh and tinkle as soon as we sit her in the warm bath (much like the sound daddy makes when he passes a large amount of gas), but tonight she was fussing and crying… ok, we’ll chalk that up as a fluke (maybe I bumped her leg when I sat her in the bath). Usually she looks up at me with that creepy smile (as stated in the blog introduction) when I lay her on her changing pad for a poop wipe, good-luck bum spank, and an anti-bum rash lubing, but tonight she was shrieking as soon as her head touched down… ok, now this is getting a bit out of the ordinary. Usually she rolls her eyes to the back of her head while we feed her that perfectly warmed bottle of milk, but tonight she was choking on it while she was crying in between gulps… shit! What the shit is going on with her? This was our first anxiety rendering experience of: “is her disease causing her pain?” “Is this just something normal for babies and our lack of experience is getting the best of us?” We tried everything. Group hugs, pep talks (“You can do this Isla, we believe in you!” “Please go to sleep or your mom and I are going to take up heroin as a hobby”), more milk, dances, double wrapping her swaddle, turning the room temperature up, turning the room temperature down, singing her lullabies… Oh! Dad to the rescue… she always settles when we put her in her car seat and swing her back and forth… NOPE… didn’t work… Holy son of a Vondruke! It was getting to be close to 3am now and Katie and I were starting to get cranky with each other. There were moments we were just sitting there with blood shot eyes, swaying back and forth, staring at a blank wall, with our hair pulled out of our heads and a baby screaming in the background. Well there’s only one more thing I can think of… let’s go for a drive for as long as it takes. I’ll fucking drive to China if I have to (by the way, a lot of the baby materials I mentioned above are on my Amazon store, check it out on the bottom of this webpage!).</p>

                                    <h2>Let’s Go Do a “B” & “E”</h2>

                                    <p>There is not much area to drive in our small town of 6,094 people (yeah I just Googled that and that was the population in 2011, do some’in!). If we drove through the greater Annapolis Valley area we would have a whole lot more terrain to cover surrounded by farmlands and mountains, but I didn’t want to take any chances. If we finally got this devil child to sleep I was pulling a U-turn (a Granny-like slow-ass U-turn as to not disturb our sleeping beauty) and we were going to drive the car right into her nursery, car seat and all (so we did not have to lift her out of her car seat to place her in bed. Protect the sleep!) We just finished our 50th lap around Paddy’s Pub (that one-way stretch of road which goes in a circle in downtown Kentville and probably totals 1 km). All of a sudden the crying stopped, thank the lord almighty. Katie reached to the back where Isla was sitting and performed her routine “check if she’s breathing” check. (Get off your high horse people, you know how ridiculous it is, but you’ve still done it). FINALLY! she was out cold (asleep, that is). We were on the home-stretch, literally, and all of a sudden I noticed an ominous sight ahead. God Dammit! It was a fucking road block. The blue and red lights were flashing, the cops were laughing and flashing their flashlights in the car windows (I guess it was 4am on a Saturday night and there are drunks out there thinking they are Nascar drivers). What freaking luck we have! If they only knew the shit storm they could potentially cause. Yes, I thought about it: “Should I rev this SUV up to it’s zero to sixty in 50 minutes, fly through this traffic stop  like we just performed a break and entry, flip the cops the bird as we blow past them, enjoy our next 12 months in jail while Isla gets a nice cozy room in a foster home at 4 months old?” Yeah probably not the best idea, but believe me, it was intriguing. Instead we begrudgingly pulled up to the traffic stop like the good obedient citizens we are, I rolled down the window, and the officer flashed his light in. I didn’t realize it at the time, but the officer probably had his own thoughts the instant his flashlight illuminated our vehicle: “Two citizens, visibly distressed, messy hair, dishevelled clothing, maybe domestic         dispute, ask the driver if he has been drinking, ask the woman in the passenger seat if everything is alright, put your hand on your gun  and… hold on.” Then he shined the light into the back seat where a baby was peacefully sleeping, immediately understands (must be a father himself) and says with a sympathetic tone: “Have a good night folks.”</p>   

                                    <p>We arrived back home and luckily Isla was still snoozing. We turned the car off, closed the car doors like we were trying to close them on a balloon without popping it, took Isla out of her carseat in a sloth-like fashion and ventured into her nursery. I think we got as far as her nursery door and: “WAAAAAAAAAAA WAAAAAAA!” I think both of our hearts skipped a few beats and we almost passed out with exhaustion. The anxiety set in again and we began to worry about her health. Maybe she was in pain? We should give the GI clinic a call tomorrow, just to be safe. The rest of the night was a blur, but I remember sometime between 5am and 6am Katie decided to strip down to her skivvies and cuddle with Isla on the couch. After about 20 minutes of the skin-to-skin cuddling I remember the crying subsided and I was dreaming.</p>

                                    <h2>Do Some Research Ya Dumbasses</h2>

                                    <p>We woke up a few hours later. The day was back to normal as well as our lovely little lady. Katie decided to do a little research and found an article on “4 month sleep regression.” Essentially, when a baby hits approximately the four month mark their brain gets to a certain level of development where they will wake themselves up. Their sleep cycles begin to get all out of whack and some start having night terrors. I was a little skeptical at first, but I was willing to do anything in order to avoid another night of terror like the previous one. The advice from the linked website provided a solution. They recommended that babies need to be put on a sleep schedule from the time they are born. When they are Isla’s age it was recommended to have her stay fed and woken up early in the morning. Do not allow her to stay awake for any longer than an hour and a half in between naps and have her nap no longer than two hours, but no shorter than an hour. You continue this routine of napping-awake-feeding schedule until they are about 6 months old and then you start to lengthen the awake duration. This all seemed like a lot of work, but I am here to say: Isla is now almost 7 months old and I stick to this schedule like it’s a fanatical religion. I have it built into my alarm clock on my cell phone and besides the couple of times her fussiness actually was caused by her disease progression (keep an eye out for these updates in the next few blog posts), there have been no more issues with sleeping at night. During our regular monthly clinic visits to see the GI folks we can confidently say: “Isla sleeps well, barely ever fussy, eats well, man we have an easy baby, she can basically take care of herself.” </p>

                                    <p>So, from one newbie to another, get those little punks on a schedule. It will save your sleep, sanity and keep you out of jail.</p>

                                    <h2>Life with a Baby</h2>
                                    <p>It’s always interesting how much entertainment a child adds to your life. Life, pre-family, has the tendency to become monotonous at times. Wake up, get ready for work, scoff down some breaky, work eight hours, come home, cook supper, clean up, little R & R, wash up, bedtime, repeat. If you do not make an effort to be creative in what you do during the work days it can be very easy to end up in a rut. With a baby on board sporadic entertainment when you least expect it is a common occurrence. With a baby we have to make an effort to have mommy and daddy time. I have a somewhat sarcastic and childish sense of humour, if you have not come to this conclusion while reading past blog posts. Therefore, the following example of a funny situation involving more doody should not be a surprise (hence the name of the blog). Sometimes when a routine diaper change turns into a massacre, you just have to laugh about it afterwards, when the pain stops...</p>
                                    <h2>Triplo Doody</h2>
                                    <p>It was a regular spring evening and Isla was about 5 months old. I had just finished putting her to bed around 7pm and all was well in the world. She usually gets up crying for food around 10pm or 11pm. My routine during night time feeds is to give her a kiss on the forehead, lift her out of her crib ever so slightly, lay her on the changing table, whip off the Huggies Snug and Dry diaper, clean up the mess with some Shoppers brand wipes, slap on a fresh diaper, hold her in our wicker rocking chair, and feed her some formula from our favourite Born Free Breeze glass bottles (text version of product placement?). On this particular night when I opened her nursery door a tumbleweed blew past the doorway, a somber wind blew out the door and into the hallway, and you could hear a Western whistle wah wahhing in the background. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was in for a gunsling’n shoot-out. When I laid her on that changing table she had a mischievous grin on her cute little button face. I am always powerless to this look and it draws me in with a sudden giddiness as I blow raspberries on her bare belly. In retrospect, I would say there was steam rising from the leg holes of her Huggies. As soon as the velcro lifted a familiar smell took my breath away. Let’s just say that it is not a pleasant smell like a freshly dried pair of trousers pulled from a drying machine. It was the biggest mess she had left me to date. Up the back, all over her onesie, in her hair, on her feet, and even on the ceiling! She began to chuckle as if to say: “good luck cleaning this one up, my bitch!” A few hours later, two empty bags of wipes, a fresh coat of paint on the ceiling, and the job was done. I made sure that cute little buttocks squeaked to the touch. Problem is, no more fresh diapers were accessible… Now there is a crucial timeframe between butt cleaning and applying a fresh pair of diapers (I call this “purgatory.” You’re not sure if you’re entering heaven or hell and you’re being judged the whole time). There was a brand new unopened box of 240 Huggies Snug and Dry in the opposite side of the room (received from Amazon family; it’s a sweet deal!). The problem is that the time it was going to take in order to run to that side of the room, pop the top of the diaper box open, rip through the pre-sealed bags of 60 diapers as though a baby calf was drowning in them; was going to push me well over purgatory to the point of no return. Fuck it! I was committed, so I made the trek to the diaper box knowing full well that Isla had her 6 shooter cocked and ready to fire at any moment. I managed to get one diaper free from these unbelievably well sealed bags. The problem was, you guessed it, Isla managed to fire off a round. It made a ricochet sound as it blew past my head while I was in a slow motion back flip of avoidance and I barely escaped the following onslaught with my life. Just as I was ravenously ripping the sealed bag of diapers open, there was just enough elasticity that my elbow whipped back and smashed the top corner of her solid oak dresser. At this very moment I was rolling around on the floor teaching Isla a whole new vocabulary of pleasant words while massaging my “not so funny” funny bone. I swore the bone was now shattered into a hundred pieces. Isla had just started wailing (not sure if it was my screams of agony or that she was just embarrassed about her second mess). So I am yelling in pain while rolling on the floor, Isla is crying and laying in a new pile of shit, and I managed to muster a few encouraging words to her:</p>
                                    <blockquote>“Don’t worry about the mess sweetie, it happens to the best of us, EVERYBODY POOPS! (while tears ran down my face)”</blockquote>
                                    <p>Now I have a throbbing elbow on one side and a mangled bag of 60 diapers on the other side which has exploded all over the floor. I am feeling confident now that I have 60 diapers on stand-by so I lean in close to Isla and whisper in her ear:</p>
                                    <blockquote>“Did he fire six shots or only five?" Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement I kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off, you've gotta ask yourself one question: "Do I feel lucky?" Well, do ya, punk?”</blockquote>
                                    <p>Well, as you probably guessed by the title, Isla had another round left in the chamber. I had just gathered my composure after this traumatic experience, finished cleaning up her second pile of smoking shells on the floor, slapped some zinc cream on her freshly cleaned bum, and then it happened… again! It started with the furrowed brow and look on her face like she was trying to solve a related rate calculus equation. There was no more joking at this point and she began to wince while clenching down on her diaphragm. Once you hear that grunting sound (similar to the sound daddy makes when he helps lift uncle Eugene’s full sized slate pool table) and the anus starts puckering, you have again passed through purgatory to enter hell. My first irrational thought during this split second was:</p>
                                    <blockquote>“Should I plug it with my finger? No Evan don’t be an idiot, she’ll explode with all of that back pressure. Just let nature take it’s course and throw your pride out the damn window.”</blockquote>
                                    <p>It was now the third time I had performed a diaper change on my little gunslinger whom I now realized could put some of my proudest toilet productions to shame. The showdown was complete and to say that I lost was an understatement. I was beginning to wonder if Katie had given birth to an alien-like shitting machine who can power a city block with the velocity of her bowel moments. Was her super cute baby exterior just an elaborate disguise? Obviously I was starting to lose my mind a bit. I had just faced an experience I would never forget from a 2 foot tall 15 pound human and the sun was starting to rise in the morning sky. I’ll finally put her to bed and pretend this was all just a dream...</p>
                                    <h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>
                                    <p>Is it uncool when you are trying to sleep and all you hear over the baby monitor is a full blown fart fest? I mean like 99 balloons were fully blown and let go before a knot was tied. Is it even more uncool that your wife always tries to blame the sounds on your innocent little 5 month old? Just kidding, ninety nine percent of the time that baby lets out full blown, norseman with lactose intolerance, farts. I do not care how old or mature you think you are; a fart sound aways gets yah.</p>
                                    <p>Food for thought...</p>

                            <p>To say the three dudes on this podcast are entertaining is a gross understatement. I started listening to their podcast before Isla was diagnosed with her disease. I was intrigued by the story of one of the hosts actually living with Cystic Fibrosis and having seen him on television in the past; I knew the podcast would be hilarious. The three hosts of Sickboy provide a disambiguation of sickness ranging from adult circumcision to depression to end stage cancer. They take a no holds barred approach and discuss everything under the sun with their guests whom are inflicted with an illnesses.

                            <p>The forum scene on the internet, especially Facebook, for diseases is very dire to say the least. There is a bunch of negativity, misinformation and people just looking for a handout. I stumbled upon Health Unlocked and finally found legitimate information on Biliary Atresia. The site covers tons of other disorders as well, so if you're looking for information or support on most diseases, you'll find it here. This site has a great forum where Katie and I discovered many other parents going through the exact same thing as us.
