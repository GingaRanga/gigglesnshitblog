                    <h2>Life with a Baby</h2>

                    <p itemprop="description" class="text-faded">It’s always interesting how much entertainment a child adds to your life. Life, pre-family, has the tendency to become monotonous at times. Wake up, get ready for work, scoff down some breaky, work eight hours, come home, cook supper, clean up, little R & R, wash up, bedtime, repeat. If you do not make an effort to be creative in what you do during the work days it can be very easy to end up in a rut. With a baby on board sporadic entertainment when you least expect it is a common occurrence. With a baby we have to make an effort to have mommy and daddy time. I have a somewhat sarcastic and childish sense of humour, if you have not come to this conclusion while reading past blog posts. Therefore, the following example of a funny situation involving more doody should not be a surprise (hence the name of the blog). Sometimes when a routine diaper change turns into a massacre, you just have to laugh about it afterwards, when the pain stops…</p>

                    <h2>Triplo Doody</h2>

                    <p class="text-faded">It was a regular spring evening and Isla was about 5 months old. I had just finished putting her to bed around 7pm and all was well in the world. She usually gets up crying for food around 10pm or 11pm. My routine during night time feeds is to give her a kiss on the forehead, lift her out of her crib ever so slightly, lay her on the changing table, whip off the Huggies Snug and Dry diaper, clean up the mess with some Shoppers brand wipes, slap on a fresh diaper, hold her in our wicker rocking chair, and feed her some formula from our favourite Born Free Breeze glass bottles (text version of product placement?). On this particular night when I opened her nursery door a tumbleweed blew past the doorway, a somber wind blew out the door and into the hallway, and you could hear a Western whistle wah wahhing in the background. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was in for a gunsling’n shoot-out. When I laid her on that changing table she had a mischievous grin on her cute little button face. I am always powerless to this look and it draws me in with a sudden giddiness as I blow raspberries on her bare belly. In retrospect, I would say there was steam rising from the leg holes of her Huggies. As soon as the velcro lifted a familiar smell took my breath away. Let’s just say that it is not a pleasant smell like a freshly dried pair of trousers pulled from a drying machine. It was the biggest mess she had left me to date. Up the back, all over her onesie, in her hair, on her feet, and even on the ceiling! She began to chuckle as if to say: “good luck cleaning this one up, my bitch!” A few hours later, two empty bags of wipes, a fresh coat of paint on the ceiling, and the job was done. I made sure that cute little buttocks squeaked to the touch. Problem is, no more fresh diapers were accessible… Now there is a crucial timeframe between butt cleaning and applying a fresh pair of diapers (I call this “purgatory.” You’re not sure if you’re entering heaven or hell and you’re being judged the whole time). There was a brand new unopened box of 240 Huggies Snug and Dry in the opposite side of the room (received from Amazon family; it’s a sweet deal!). The problem is that the time it was going to take in order to run to that side of the room, pop the top of the diaper box open, rip through the pre-sealed bags of 60 diapers as though a baby calf was drowning in them; was going to push me well over purgatory to the point of no return. Fuck it! I was committed, so I made the trek to the diaper box knowing full well that Isla had her 6 shooter cocked and ready to fire at any moment. I managed to get one diaper free from these unbelievably well sealed bags. The problem was, you guessed it, Isla managed to fire off a round. It made a ricochet sound as it blew past my head while I was in a slow motion back flip of avoidance and I barely escaped the following onslaught with my life. Just as I was ravenously ripping the sealed bag of diapers open, there was just enough elasticity that my elbow whipped back and smashed the top corner of her solid oak dresser. At this very moment I was rolling around on the floor teaching Isla a whole new vocabulary of pleasant words while massaging my “not so funny” funny bone. I swore the bone was now shattered into a hundred pieces. Isla had just started wailing (not sure if it was my screams of agony or that she was just embarrassed about her second mess). So I am yelling in pain while rolling on the floor, Isla is crying and laying in a new pile of shit, and I managed to muster a few encouraging words to her:</p>

                        <blockquote>“Don’t worry about the mess sweetie, it happens to the best of us, EVERYBODY POOPS! (while tears ran down my face)”</blockquote>

					<p class="text-faded">Now I have a throbbing elbow on one side and a mangled bag of 60 diapers on the other side which has exploded all over the floor. I am feeling confident now that I have 60 diapers on stand-by so I lean in close to Isla and whisper in her ear:</p>

                        <blockquote>“Did he fire six shots or only five?" Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement I kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off, you've gotta ask yourself one question: "Do I feel lucky?" Well, do ya, punk?”</blockquote>

                    <p class="text-faded">Well, as you probably guessed by the title, Isla had another round left in the chamber. I had just gathered my composure after this traumatic experience, finished cleaning up her second pile of smoking shells on the floor, slapped some zinc cream on her freshly cleaned bum, and then it happened… again! It started with the furrowed brow and look on her face like she was trying to solve a related rate calculus equation. There was no more joking at this point and she began to wince while clenching down on her diaphragm. Once you hear that grunting sound (similar to the sound daddy makes when he helps lift uncle Eugene’s full sized slate pool table) and the anus starts puckering, you have again passed through purgatory to enter hell. My first irrational thought during this split second was:</p>

                        <blockquote>“Should I plug it with my finger? No Evan don’t be an idiot, she’ll explode with all of that back pressure. Just let nature take it’s course and throw your pride out the damn window.”</blockquote>

                    <p class="text-faded">It was now the third time I had performed a diaper change on my little gunslinger whom I now realized could put some of my proudest toilet productions to shame. The showdown was complete and to say that I lost was an understatement. I was beginning to wonder if Katie had given birth to an alien-like shitting machine who can power a city block with the velocity of her bowel moments. Was her super cute baby exterior just an elaborate disguise? Obviously I was starting to lose my mind a bit. I had just faced an experience I would never forget from a 2 foot tall 15 pound human and the sun was starting to rise in the morning sky. I’ll finally put her to bed and pretend this was all just a dream...</p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>

                    <p class="text-faded">Is it uncool when you are trying to sleep and all you hear over the baby monitor is a full blown fart fest? I mean like 99 balloons were fully blown and let go before a knot was tied. Is it even more uncool that your wife always tries to blame the sounds on your innocent little 5 month old? Just kidding, ninety nine percent of the time that baby lets out full blown, norseman with lactose intolerance, farts. I do not care how old or mature you think you are; a fart sound aways gets yah.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">Food for thought...</p>

                                    <p>It’s early April of 2015. My wife Katie and I are on one of our leisurely drives around town looking at random houses while dreaming, critiquing, and scoffing at the sites. I am not sure if this is a normal thing couples do, but when we  have nothing better to do some evenings, we like to hop in our late 2012 Nissan Rogue and drive through neighbourhoods. Sometimes when we see a beautiful house we even slow down, take pictures as the SUV crawls by, and then speed away before people call the cops on us. So far we have not had any jail time so I’d say we are professionals.</p>

                                    <p>On this particular night in April, we were on our way home and we were having a somewhat civil argument. Before I get into details of the argument I will give you a quick run down of our history. I do not want you to think our relationship is doomed because of a silly fight which turned out to be one of the best nights of our relationship (oh the suspense, I know!).</p>

                                    <p>I met Katie in high school in a town/ suburb/ city/ (who knows what the fuck to classify the shit hole where I grew up). Google: “Sack-Vegas” and the first hit will give you a good idea of my roots. Yes that is a “Welcome to the Wonderful Sack-Vegas” sign and yes it was actually a real sign placed by the highway leaving town, which made local the news before it was taken down.
                                    Go to You Tube and search: “Lower Sackville Promo” and you will find a wonderful video with a very accurate description of my hometown (the narrative is to die for).
                                    You know what… screw searching for these things… it is 2016 and I am not a moron (some might disagree) so check out the link and embedded video below. I can just see my aunt Juanita saying: “Evan, you said to Google Sack-Vegas and now all of my Facebook friends see my new profile picture of what looks to be a nice, well-formed pair of breasts in the latest Victoria’s Secret bra until they click on it and reveal a hairy, obese man’s ass-crack in a pair of polka dot bros (Seinfeld reference).” Or my mother Ethel saying: “Evan, you said to look-up Lower Sackville Promo on You Tube and now a man named Rasheed from Windows said my computer was infected with viruses and I no longer have a left kidney.” I’ll save you the trouble… </p>

                                    <p>Sorry about that tangent, now back to the main story: we met at Sackville High. I was fresh out of a relationship and my friend, who never knew how to stay away from the “friend-zone,” devised a new (failure) of a scheme to pickup a lady-friend whom he had eyes for. This lady-friend turned out to be friends with my now current and only wife. All he had to do was tell me I was on the list of who she found cute in high school and I was like “BAM! Cat in the bag!” Triple date time with two of my good lads. It was Halloween night and we went out to see one of the worst movies to franchises in existence: “Saw.” You know, the first one, the one where the guy uses a jig-saw to cut off his hand to escape the game. My 4 year old nephew can act better than that for a Klondike bar. The movie went well, my two buddies bitched out and went home afterwards, and Katie had a fabulous idea to keep the night young. “Let’s go trick or treating.” (to many of my friend’s and families’ dismay my trick or treating went on until I was into my early 20s).</p>

                                    <p>So here I am stuck with Katie and two other girls, by myself, trick or treating (i know, rough life, eh?). Problem was I did not have anything to wear, come to think of it, none of us did. We started at Katie’s house and she rummaged through her things and whipped together four costumes. I only remember her costume and mine because obviously they were the two best ones. Katie’s costume was a simple pair of white long john’s and rubber boots and mine ended up being a dress with a tight, pointy elf hat (go figure…). In retrospect the next thing that happened turned out to be a short and meaningful moment in which I will never forget. On our way out to bag ourselves a good bounty of candy I had my first interaction with Katie’s father. Her mother loved me right away, but that is just the type of lovely and personable person she is. Katie’s dad on the other hand is a more reserved individual who believes in the more old school ways of father son-in-law relationships. Truth is he loves his two daughters more than anything in the world and if anyone hurt them they would probably be shot (he has even shown me the collection of guns and bullets he owns and loves to take me to the shooting range, just he and myself and no witnesses). But hey, now that I am a father of a beautiful innocent baby girl, I can completely understand. Now that I have made it into the inner circle I know most of it is a front and deep down he is a big softy. Any who… I think that was anther small tangent… maybe I have a problem. So this moment I will never forget was when I came out of Katie’s room with two of her girlfriends, wearing a green (I think floral patterned) dress with a tight red and yellow elf cap. As I was walking out of the house I walked past the master bedroom where Katie’s father was laying down watching a show. At the time I did not think anything of it because I had no idea who this man was, but in retrospect I am lucky I have been around this long. It is nerve-racking to meet the girlfriend’s father in the first place, but try doing it while dressed up like an idiot, with sweaty palms and a goofy smile on your face. Luckily there was only a quick, “Who the fuck is this dumbass?!” moment, where he was caught off guard just as much as I was and all we could both muster was a quick: “Hey!” with a nod. Come to think of it, I got off easy with her father on several occasions over the last decade due to catching him off guard. Asking him if I could marry his daughter was another one of these occasions, but I will spare you another tangent and mention that in a future blog post. I know, pretty insignificant and small moment there, big guy… but if you guys know Katie’s father or if I described him well enough, I am sure you get how huge that split second was. I doubt in that moment he thought he was seeing the man of his daughter’s dreams.</p>

                                    <p>The rest of the evening went very well. Katie was the first down to earth, funny, sexy girl I had ever met. I was beginning to think that a girl such as this, in Lower Sackville (Nova Scotia, Canada), was a unicorn (see one of my favourite videos describing a unicorn below). </p>

                                    <p>To be honest, I only went on the date as a favour to my “friend-zone” buddy as I was not looking for anything serious at the time. I think the moment I knew this girl was worth a second glance was while we were walking up to our first house for candy. As we were walking, I did not realize (sorry Katie and your family), but I was staring at her perfectly formed, upside-down heart shaped booty being cradled by the tight long-johns like a mother holding a baby in each arm. I realized I was in a trance when Katie looked back at me and boldly said: “Well if you’re going to stare at it you might as well grab it,” to which I giddyingly &copy; obliged. At that moment was the first time I had realized I met my match.</p>

                                    <p>Skip ahead 11 years, past many many more stories, trials and tribulations; back to April 2015. Don’t worry, I am sure the many details of those 11 years will come out in future tangents. Here we are again, arguing about when and if we will ever be ready to start a family (and this is not the first time we had this argument, but it is a memorable one for sure). Truth is, there is never a perfect time. I have known my whole life that I wanted to start a family someday. I would even have 15 kids if it were financially and mentally feasible (when you are not living on a farm). Katie definitely wanted a child or two, but was a little more apprehensive about it than I. You already know my wife has a very endearing potty mouth, but one other thing you do not know is that she has OCD (or C-D-O as she lamely likes to call it because that is alphabetical order). She likes to have every detail planned out and organized. The problem with this and having a child is that they clash. If you are truly serious about diving into the wonderful world of being a parent then you need an ounce of impulsiveness and faith that everything will be alright. When you are up at 4 am, after 4 weeks straight of your baby screeching, whilst knowing you need to be up in an hour to drive to your place of work (so that you can muster out a good zombified 8 hours of bullshit), you definitely need to have faith that everything will be alright. This lackadaisical demeanor is a lot easier for a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants type of guy guy like myself, but not so much for a OCD planner. Needless to say, we had some clashing of opinions about when this family thing was gong to start and this night in April 2015 was no exception. We didn’t get anywhere in our argument that night. We ended up storming into the house together and going into separate rooms. I was beginning to wonder if I would be needing Viagra by the time she would be ready, but also knowing I would make that a reality if I kept pushing. I am out in the living room watching a show when I hear Katie having a maniacal laughing fit in the bathroom and calling out my name. After I check that all of the knives are in the knife block and my gun is locked away, I cautiously walk towards the bathroom. She whips up a pregnancy test (in which I dive out of the way of, in fear of urine landing on my face) and there are two blue lines. Oh and you know she ain’t leaving it at one test with all of the false positives running around out there. She opens a drawer and out fall ten more tests all with the same two blue lines (ok, ten is a slight exaggeration for effect, it was probably only one more, but I wouldn’t be surprised if she had a drawer somewhere).</p>

                                    <p>All is forgotten of the aforementioned argument that night, we hold each other with tears in our eyes and laughing due to the irony of what just happened. I may have mustered out: “guess we have no choice now,” as I look nervously over her shoulder at the pair of scissors behind her back….</p>

                                    <p>Just kidding (about the scissors)!</p>

When people find out you are going to become a parent, a grey cloud emerges in the sky, thunder crashes around you, a red haze fills the air and pure evil seems to indoctrinate anyone you speak to. "Once that miniature devil is born, say goodbye to your life as you know it and hello to the worse years of your life!" "That thing will ruin your wife's body and you will never sleep, have sex, or a peaceful moment again!" Really people? Is it really that bad or are you just boring and narcissistic about accomplishing such an amazing feat that you just HAVE to tell the world about how you survived it? Why the hell do people even start a family if it's so overwhelmingly difficult?</p>

                                    <p>For all of you soon-to-be parents/spouses of a pregnant woman out there, I'm here to say: "it's really not that bad." Now I know some mothers have complicated pregnancies and some mothers lack support from a partner, so I understand there can be some truth in the negativity of pregnancy and birth. Fortunately Katie's first pregnancy was relatively straight forward (that doesn't mean there weren't funny situations throughout). In my opinion, even in some really shitty situations, I think it is all about your perspective. There is always a silver lining of positivity and humour even in the worst situations. I have observed the people who have told me the "horror stories" of pregnancy and raising a child, and to be honest I'm not surprised. Pacifying their children with a smartphone, sheltering their children from what's important in life (i.e. not allowing them to fail in school when they clearly are or the famous: everyone is a winner crap), not believing in discipline or saying "no" to their child, and buying into the next hippy-dippy parenting thing they read on Facebook (do you know people actually save their placentas and convert them into pill form for nutrition? Isn't that cannibalism??). Come on people, are you really surprised you're having a difficult time with parenting? "No Mr. Teacher (who has forty more years of maturing on this planet than my five year old) my son would never kick up sand into the face of some douchebag kid who stole his popcorn at recess." “Well guess what Mr. Parent, kids are little assholes and so were you when you were that age so get your head out of the clouds and let the poor teacher do his job.”  Isn't it our responsibility to provide care and love to our women carrying one of the most precious things in human creation for nine months (within reason... they aren't completely useless and you know they will milk it once in a while)? Isn't it our responsibility to let these innocent, underdeveloped creatures learn the ways of this cruel world with our guidance? One of my favourite sayings is: "un-coachable children grow up to be un-employable adults." Don't ask me who said that. I'm the type of person who forgets your name as soon as my hand leaves the handshake. The saying is so true though. I have seen it by watching parents and managing staff for years. Don't do that to your children people. It's more important to let your child screw something up and be there to show them how to fix it than to try and prevent them from ever making the mistake in the first place. That's just one rookie ginger father's opinion... Maybe I'll be wrong and I'm sure you'll hear about it on here.</p>

                                    <p>Back to Katie and her fabulous belly. Katie and I probably piss people off once in a while about our health and nutrition craziness. We believe that the food we eat and how we cook it needs to be as close to the source as possible (except for Cadbury Mini Eggs... Mini Eggs are exempt). Maybe it's just a coincidence but people who know me know that I used to be a pretty intense athlete and in great shape. Then I went to university, quit competitive paddling and everything went to shit. The thing is, besides being a little squishier in the abdomen and breathing heavier going up a flight of stairs, I have managed to maintain the same weight for the last 10 years. I attribute that strongly to our diet. Anyways, I'm not going to bore you with a health and nutrition rant, I just wanted to mention that because it is what we believe made Katie's pregnancy pretty straight forward. You don’t have to drastically change your lifestyle when you’re pregnant unless your lifestyle includes sniffing bath salts, smoking crack or binge drinking with sororities on the weekends. It took forever for her belly to show, the mood swings were relatively non-existent (until the final month or so), there were no weird cravings (i.e. anchovies and Sour Patch Kids), she was still pretty active and generally pleasant to be around (mind blown?). We always got a kick out of how people become very inconsiderate when they make comments to a pregnant woman. For example: "Holy shit, you are getting huge." "Oh man, are you carrying twins?" Thank god Katie had some self esteem or I would have come home to her crying in the corner surrounded by a bunch of Lipozene cartons and chocolate bar wrappers. It is what I like to call "nonversation." Sorry, unfortunately I can't copyright that because I did not come up with it. Working in retail you develop a strong aversion to "nonversation." It is when people are so socially stunted that when they meet with you they can't carry a normal conversation and end up mustering: "so how about that weather out there, only in Nova Scotia eh?!" "Working hard or hardly working, muhahahah?" "Did you see that Montreal game last night? Leafs fans are laughing now I'm sure." I always stay professional in these dire situations even though I want to grab the nearest stapler, dip it in some vinegar, and... I'll let you figure out the rest of that sentence. Then you have those assholes who find out, I'm staying at home while Katie is going to bring home the bacon, saying things like: "That's the least he can do since you carried a baby for nine grueling months (like I was some useless piece of shit, drooling while I  stared out into space for nine months)." Or the ones that look at you like you have pickles for ears while awkwardly saying: "Well, good for you (like I'm attempting to find the cure for cancer or something)." Well, telling a pregnant woman she is large is up there with some of the worst nonversation.</p>

                                    <p>Now that I think about it, some of the worst parts of being pregnant are the other people. Hey, maybe her pregnancy went so well because her husband is so amazing and cautious (because he knew that one false move she would do as the Black Widow spider does). Well there were two such moments where I, in retrospect, may have slipped.</p>

                                    <h3 class="header-text">Moment #1: The Peanut Butter Burger Massacre</h3>

                        			<p>This slip up was very early on (and I mean early). It was actually soon after the story of my last post. My wife wanted to keep the news of her being pregnant under lock and key until the end of first trimester (oh, in case you haven't realized, I hate the term "we" are pregnant it just makes me feel weird like I have to start wearing maternity clothes or something). I can understand why she felt this way, with the prevalence of miscarriages and not wanting to have to share such a loss with the world. I just think she kept forgetting that I had super sperm and “there ain't no way that was gonna happen…" Anyways, here we are (my best mate Josh and I), me just finding out I was going to have my first baby, super excited and my best friend had no idea. You know I had to tell him. Did I say this was only a few days after we found out from that bucket full of pregnancy tests? Josh and I were on our way to a quaint little restaurant in Halifax by the name of Darrell's. They are famous for their unsettlingly delicious "peanut butter burger." It is exactly as it sounds. The same as any other burger, dressed the way you want, with a glob of creamy smooth peanut butter on the bun. I was skeptical at first too, but Mmmmmm mmmmm. Josh and I are just arriving at the restaurant and decide to wait in the big ass lineup. Katie calls me and asks how things are going and for some stupid reason I decide to tell her that Josh wants to celebrate our news. She be all like: “News?! What news!? I am not even sure she took a breath throughout the next 10 minutes as she vocally abused me. It was so loud that the pair of dudes in front of us in line turned around and gave me the classic: duuuude, we are so sorry to hear you have been castrated, hopefully she is good in the sack, look. Once the peanut butter burger massacre was finished we joyously forgot the events of the past and mowed down our burgers in delight. Oh, you thought that was the end of it, hahahaha NO. Josh is like the Antwerp Diamond Centre Vault when it comes to keeping secrets. So much so that when I told him he absolutely could not tell anyone my news (for the sake of my well-being), he did not even tell his fiancée until she found out he didn’t. The secret-keeping-code he lives by is so ingrained that until this day I am sure he still doesn't understand why his now current wife was so upset (it was dicey whether or not they were even going to get married due to this… just kidding but seriously if you ever have a secret you need to get off your chest just talk to Josh). We all survived the peanut butter burger massacre and lived to tell the tale.</p>

                                    <h3 class="header-text">Moment #2: The Watermelon Incident</h3>

                       				<p>So, we have finally arrived at the watermelon incident! Besides the very early slip-up, I did pretty good up until the last month of Katie’s pregnancy. During this time was when Katie started showing some of the more traditional pregnancy symptoms. Super tiredness, super hungriness (or as I likes to call it: prangry &copy), super absentmindedness (or as Josh likes to call it: placenta brain &copy), and super moodiness. I think the problem here was that I was getting used to how smooth the pregnancy was going that I slipped and fell into a pile of an argument with my plump-ripe wifey. It was such an un-important, stupid argument that neither one of us even remember what it was about (probably about whether or not Icelanders consume more Coca-Cola per Capita than any other nation). The premise of the argument is not important though, the events that unfolded next would change how I viewed pregnancy for the rest of my days. I tend to poke the bear when I get frustrated in an argument and say anything that will just set her off (I know: “Evan you are so much smarter than that”). This trait was even more of an issue when my beautiful wife couldn’t even bend over to put on her shoes. Needless to say, I poked mother bear while she was munching out on a watermelon, cut in half, in a tiny bowl. I was standing on the other side of the room and I saw the flames in her eyes, steam exiting her ears and it was in slow motion. The watermelon, bowl and all, floated ever so slightly into the air like a bullet followed by the small explosion of the gun powder. It zipped past my head with a whistling sound and exploded all over her Macbook and wall behind me. I was in so much shock that I went mute, put on my shoes and left to get cat litter so that our cats would love us again. There it is folks. That is the gist of Katie’ pregnancy. We both survived and are stronger because of it.</p>

                                    <p>Peace out!</p>

                                    <p>Let's recap: We had an awkward butt wiping, we had a Halloween-long-John reception, we had watermelons flying and a peanut butter burgers feast. Now we are finally here. We are at the day that you know is coming, you try to prepare for, but always end up in a bag full-o-emotions. Labour Day, and not the fun one.</p>

                                    <p>Leading up to Labour Day was like those stupid Facebook videos with the beautiful rolling hills, somber Irish background music, with a car leisurely coasting through the twisty turns (you know what's coming but not sure when) and then BAM! An ugly zombie-looking monster pops up in your field of view just to startle you. Except in this instance no zombie creature pops up. It is a goopy and alien-like creature, but I wouldn't say a zombie. </p>

                                    <p>We knew it was getting down to the crunch. Katie had finally taken work off due to her swollen kankles and due to falling asleep while face to face with staff members during a conversation. It was three weeks before her due date and we were anxiously awaiting our little bambino's arrival.</p>

                                    <p>We made it to about a week prior to the due date. November 10<sup>th</sup> 2015. We had a little bag prepared (not too much packed since we live about 1 minute away from the hospital or Katie's place of work), our minds were prepared and we knew we were going to be having a long day. People had gone from asking me how Katie was doing once a week to asking a couple times a day. It got to the point where I simply responded by saying: "If you see me run out of here like someone just told me my house was broken into (this actually happened), then you know how she's doing." Did I mention I work an hour away from home as well as the hospital? (I know eh, Katie drew the longer straw, but you can get the princess out of the castle but you can't get the princess out of the girl... Not sure if that makes any sense but it's provocative eh?) Luckily I did not need to turn my 2009 Hyundai Elantra into a NASCAR and Labour Day came while we were both at home.</p>

                                    <p>Just a note to all of you "new to being fathers" out there: When your wife invites you into the bathroom, when she is within a week of her due date, it is not for a party if you know what I mean... Katie had just finished her shower and called for me while I was still in bed sleeping. She was startled by some fluid running down her leg in the shower, which she was pretty sure wasn't the shower water or pee (who knows, she might be one of those gross people who let the bladder rip in the shower). She simply said: "Babe, I think I've gone into labour." Skadoosh! I was ready for this day. I had read all of the online blogs about how to support your wife during labour, I had my camera ready for the "belfie" (again, I unfortunately can't copyright that beautiful word), I did my morning push-ups for a month, and stretched on the hour</p>

                                    <p>Not very much of the aforementioned things were true. I know you are shocked that I did not do daily push-ups, but it's true, I'm just blessed with this perfect body naturally (I did read up on supporting wifey during labour, but I'm not even sure the bag came with us to the hospital). So here's the life lesson I learned on Labour Day: You can plan all you want, not much if any of it will actually happen, just be there.</p>

                                    <p>Everything was pretty low key at this moment. I think I even saw a glimmer of hope in Katie's eyes: “Hey, if this is the pain, I don't know what all of those pansy mothers have been bitching about all of these years." We hopped into our SUV and began the 1 minute journey to the hospital. I learned, once we got there, that false alarms are a common occurrence because everyone was pretty chill. No one was dropping everything they were doing to push the pregnant lady to the ER, while punching out anyone who got in the way (you know like on the TV shows).</p>

                                    <p>No, it was all pretty straight forward. Obviously Katie's labour was going to be just as straight forward as her pregnancy, less those couple moments mentioned in my last post. They completed the fluid test and confirmed that "yes" her water broke. They hooked her up to the machine from ancient times, which spits out what you would see on a Richter scale, to time her contractions. Not much has changed in this medical technology... I mean hey, some crazy women are popping those little creatures out in their home bathtub. We got moved to the labour and delivery room as the contractions gradually got stronger and as Katie's look of: “Pssh, this is going to be a breeze" slowly turned into: “Damn, this shit hurts."</p>

                                    <p>Katie wanted to try to do things as natural as possible. No pain medication,  no cesarean section, no epidural, etc. I, as well as everyone else, respected that even though we were all thinking: “Good luck with that." Once you are feeling the pain of birth and you know the good stuff (medication) is in the next room, it is amazing how quickly your morals change. I have to hand it to her though; she stuck to her guns for the most part. Besides an occasional shot of Fentanyl and sucking on the gas mask like you suck on a Freezie to get the last remnants of that beautifully sweet surprise at the end; she held in there. She’s one tough mo fo.</p>

                                    <p>One more tip for all of you soon-to-be parents out there: There is no time in which you can't have an epidural (we learned this after the fact). Some staff will fight you on it because it can slow things down, which can be risky, but if you want it you go girlfriend! Well, Katie did eventually want it. When you're in enough pain and you've gained a tolerance to the gas, you will do anything to get rid of the pain. You don't care that there is a room full of people looking directly at your goodies. You don't care about the trauma that will be done to your taco. You don't care that you just mentally scarred that poor resident for sticking her fingers in your already stretched petunia. JUST... GET... ME... THAT... EPIDURAL!</p>

                                    <p>We finally convinced them to allow the epidural to happen. Here is something you don't want to hear when you get to this stage of labour and they wheel in the "epidural kit," (which looks just like that red metal tool box my father in law has in his garage, with a sticker label on it): "Well ok, we just want to warn you, the doctor is very particular and he likes to explain everything thoroughly before starting." "So he's slow as fuck?!" Well slow is an understatement. That dickhead was so slow he didn't even show up. He's probably still on his way to Isla's birth, five months later!</p>

                                    <p>Needless to say, Katie, unintentionally did not get to enjoy the pleasures of birth offered by the glorious epidural. Her labour started progressing to the point of no return. Isla was ready to see the world! Isla's heart rate was dropping with each contraction, in line with Katie's possessed screams to the holy hell. They wasted no time and attached the heart rate monitor to Isla's head (did you know they actually screw this into her head?! That shit is messed up!). They got Katie's OBGYN into the room followed by the torturer (poor resident), followed by a team of paediatricians. So you knew it was game time. They attached a suction to Isla's head in order to assist with Katie's pushing. I think 50 people’s faces and hands were all up in Katie's business at this point. Between you-me, you feel pretty useless as a husband in this room. I guess besides the back rubs and consoling, while your wife is on all fours pushing a human into the world, you feel pretty inadequate. It all happened pretty quickly now. One snip, one push, one Doctor yanking at your baby, one wide-eyed husband rocking in the corner and POP! Out comes what is the greatest blessing of your life.</p>

                                    <p>Katie was cute in this moment and looked up at me to ask how I was doing to which I just laughed and incredulously said: "how am I doing?!" I'm a pretty calm cool and collected guy who shows little emotion, but when that baby was handed to me I was a bubbling basket of emotions. I don't know if it was happiness or relief that my hand might regain feeling again one day. Just as quickly as the room filled, it was empty again. The room did not look as if life had been brought into it, but actually quite the contrary. There were blood smears on the floor, stains of every shade on the blankets, a panting pain relieved mother on the bed, and a father in the corner who could not stop staring at his creation. Even with all of that we still managed to snap a few pics of our little girl for the herds of friends and family anxiously waiting (make sure you follow Giggles N Shit Blog on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gigglesnshitblog/">Instagram</a> so you don't miss any of these pics).</p>

                                    <p>I always said newborn babies looked like a combination of alien and red jelly bellies, but when it's your own child you're "blinded by the light, revved up like a douche and running through the night" (I know those aren't the right lyrics but great song nonetheless). Your child always looks beautiful, but now looking at pictures before and after, she definitely looked like my little cherry jelly bean. </p>

                                    <p>I am still amazed at how much you love that little peanut instantly. I've never had it hit me right away like that. With a spouse it takes time and effort. With family you know you have to love them no matter what. I don't believe in all of the Hollywood fairy tale bullshit of love at first sight, fate, etc, but I have to say with Isla it was definitely love at first site.</p>

                                    <p><h3>And so Isla's story begins! Weighing in at 7 pounds 1 ounce, and arriving at approximately 4 pm, on November 10<sup>th</sup>, 2015. </h3></p>

                                    <p><strong>P.S.</strong> I now understand why we have no recollection of our births. That shit is traumatic.</p>

                                    <p>So here we are. It is Monday April 11th (5 days before Katie's 28th birthday. Had to say that in this post as she never remembers her age and it is scary). It will be Isla's third trip to see her paediatrician. This Thursday will be her zillionth time seeing her GI specialist and blood clinic (I know, zillion is an exaggeration, but it's been a lot). The thing is, am I going to tell you why? Of course not! You will have to read on punk! Oooohhh, bomb drop, no he didn't? Yes he did! Title drop... I digress.</p>

                                    <p>Let's start over. We left off with Katie spitting out a baby human from her Hoo Hah. Why not start there? We are now in the maternity unit at the Valley Regional Hospital and being treated like royalty for some reason (maybe it's because Katie is the big bad boss lady and scares the crap out of everyone? Maybe not...). Everything is going fairly smooth.  I mean, those fuckers don't sleep, but other than that everything is swell. We had regular visits from the paediatrician (not the one mentioned above, but the hospital one. I'll do my best to keep things straight for ya over the next couple of posts (there are a lot of professionals so keep up!). I know their job is important and all, but it seems the gist of what they do is come into your room while you are stress ridden and lacking sleep. Next, they mosey on over to your FINALLY sleeping baby, whip off their onesie, start poking at their bellies, rotating their legs ever so slightly, wake the damn baby up, and then leave the room with an evil chuckle. I'm just kidding, they're great. Isla had frequent visits from nurses and blood collection. She got her little heel poked and squeezed in order to check a battery of different things. She took that poke like a champ, too. That's important to me, because I'm the biggest pansy around when it comes to needles. I can handle blood, several broken bones, ruptured appendix, etc, but when that little sliver of metal pierces my body, this 6' 3" lug collapses like a ton of bricks. Yes I know, I'm a big baby. There's feeble little old ladies that go in on a regular basis whom are so cool with those torture devices that they almost take it from the technician’s hand and poke themselves. I had to have at least one flaw yah know!</p>

                                    <p>It's amazing how long you can just stare at this wondrous creation of yours. I'm serious, MGM or Fox needs to jump on this opportunity and make a movie/time-lapse video of some random baby being a baby. That shit would be a hit!! We were in the hospital for two days. These two days felt a lot longer due to our sleeping arrangements. When you're sleeping on a rickety old cot made for a little person and a blanket that's basically the size of a bath towel; it ain’t fun. It was all worth it in the end, though, or at least we kept telling ourselves that... Flash forward to an extremely sleepless night during the first week we brought Isla home. She was fussy as all hell and we were at our wits end with ways to settle her. Both of us were sitting down, hair standing at its ends, panting, and Katie looks up at me to say: "I can't do this anymore." (by the way, Katie is someone who needs all of her sleep in order to function properly so you can imagine the shape she was in). I stood up and abruptly said: "Alright, pack up her things, let's give her back!" That's basically my role in our relationship and it has been working quite well for the last 12 years. When Katie is being a drama queen, I say something stupid to lighten the mood.</p>

                                    <p>Flash back again to a few days prior to the day we were ready to enforce the return policy on Isla. We were at the hospital for our final day, full of anticipation to get the "all clear" for her routine tests and head home. Everything is how it should be. She is responsive, her belly pokes reveal normality, and she even had that disgusting amniotic poop (the one that looks like molasses (knew there was a reason I didn't trust molasses). The only concern they had was her bilirubin levels were on the high side of normal (hence the extra day at the hospital). For those of you who don’t know, bilirubin is the active part of your bile, which is secreted from your liver and into your small intestine. It’s main function is the break down of red blood cells and digestion of fat in your diet (by no means is that the medical definition, but it is my understanding. There will be more layman's definitions to come as we have had many’a learnings over the last few months). That's fairly normal though and even if her levels didn't drop they would just give her her first trip to the tanning bed and say goodbye to her newborn jaundice. Long story short, the bilirubin levels did drop and we were released that day. We bundled her up in her car seat like an easily bruised kiwi, carried her out to the SUV like she would shatter if dropped, and headed home to our new normal!</p>

                                    <p>We learned that at a few days old Isla was definitely a princess. When putting her down for a nap she needed the following: tightly wrapped swaddle blanket (see my "must haves” section below, they are freakin' awesome and fairly priced), a perfect temperature of 26 to 28 degrees Celsius, near pitch black room, and constant white noise (also in my “must haves” section). If any of those variables are missing you can pretty much kiss your sleep goodbye. Katie's genes definitely kicked the shit out of my rare Ginger Genes. Luckily Isla got her mothers deep brown eyes, darker complexion, brown hair (what little of it she has), and a mini-me face of her mother. Come to think of it, if it wasn't for how long that baby was, I would have bene looking for a paternity test. Either Katie hooked up with the Purolator man or Isla just asexually budded off of her mother.</p>

                                    <p>Katie had researched just about everything baby related prior to Isla's arrival. She even looked up a very descriptive  and picturesque step by step guide to how poop colour/texture should look at all stages of a babies' life (I thought it was gross, but I have learned now how important this is, so make sure you know your babies' poop!). We were a little over a month in and starting to get into a good routine with our baby girl. The first two weeks were a shit show, but it's surprising how innately parenting is just picked up. So all of you soon-to-be parents out there, take it from me, things will work out just fine. We were starting to have some concerns however. Isla's jaundice wasn't decreasing in her skin and the sclera of her eyes (that’s the white part of your eyes). Her poop wasn't the bright yellow colour we were expecting, but was in fact quite pale-grey. She wasn't gaining weight as quickly as the baby growth chart was expecting (parents, make sure you are keeping an eye on all of these milestones of a newborn. Parents will always know best, but you need to do a little research with the guidance of your doctor). The lack of growth was a tough one as Katie and I believed strongly in the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding, but unfortunately had to make the compromise of supplementing with formula. We still didn't go exclusively to formula, which I thought was a good compromise. It seemed that Isla agreed as well, since it helped her growth get back on track and even helped her sleep longer at night. Because breastfeeding jaundice is quite common and she was back to normal growth, our family doctor wasn't too concerned with Isla's progression. Thank god Katie was so obsessed with Isla's poop as you will soon understand! As soon as that waft of pleasant odor reached Katie's nose (from up to a mile away), you would hear her feet drop to the floor and she would run towards me to tackle the diaper out of my hand for inspection. If it wasn't for the poop inspection, our family doctor never would have referred us to a local paediatrician (who goes above and beyond any health professional I've ever met. Amazing dude), and we never would have made it to our newest normal with Isla.</p>

                                    <p>Ok, I'm finally going to tell you. Hopefully the suspense is unbearable now for you, my lovely readers, who do not know our family personally (I know, leading you on like this was a dick move, but we have made it). It was mid December 2015. Isla was just over a month old. I was working in the city and Katie was in the midst of her 4 months maternity leave (we decided I'd take the remaining 8 months, hence the term Fommy. Best decision of my life). It was the day Katie brought Isla in to see her paediatrician. It was about 6:30 pm when I got home from work and Katie had waited for me to arrive home before telling me how the doctor’s visit went. I remember walking in the door and seeing Katie holding our sweet baby girl tightly with tears in her eyes. She said the meeting did not go so well. Our whole lives we have been extremely fortunate so I always assume the best outcome, which makes it that much harder to hear bad news for once. However, we knew someday it was bound to happen. The paediatrician agreed that the jaundice and pale coloured poop was concerning. He advised Katie to head to the Valley Regional Hospital that day and get blood work done. He told us that there could be several reasons for these symptoms, but he wanted to rule out the most serious one, which is a dandy little disease called Biliary Atresia. This is where we learned that our paediatrician was a god send and he takes his career to a whole new level of awesomeness. He called Katie after hours to share with her the abnormal blood results and he called multiple times afterwards to ensure we were doing ok as well as having all of our questions answered. Our doctor presumed, with the risk of Biliary Atresia, that we would be admitted into the IWK Children's Hospital in Halifax. Unfortunately, he was correct and we took a trip to the hospital a couple days after the blood was drawn.</p>

                                    <p>You will soon see that our little Bambino is one tough SOB and she was damn good at getting me off work, un-planned (arriving a week early and now with a potential health issue). I would prefer to get off work for other reasons, but thank you dear. The holidays were now creeping up, we had just been admitted to the IWK (the bomb hasn't been dropped yet), and we don't even realize how our lives will change, yet again.</p>

                                    <p>The nail-biting day had arrived. The day we were to find out if our precious little peanut was just messing with us or about to change our lives. We had packed for about a week and had hoped it would not be any longer than that. Usually having most of our close friends living in Halifax (1.5 hours away from home) was inconvenient unless we needed a place to crawl back to after a night of “apple juice” drinking, however, this trip it was a god-send. Especially my best bud’s wife, Cindy. They lived about a 10 minute walk from the IWK and they went above and beyond during our stay at the hospital. They offered a room in their house for us to stay, if needed, and Cindy checked in on us almost everyday. Katie and I dropped off all of our luggage at the Snillis’ (name changed in order to protect their identity) and headed to the hospital to get Isla admitted. Who would have known Isla’s first big outing would be to the IWK, how exciting… </p>

                                    <p>First thing’s first: we headed on down to the first floor of the hospital to get Isla setup for her ultrasound. They wanted to get a look at her liver and other organs as a first measure diagnostic. Isla loved the ultrasound (as evidenced by her sleeping through the entire exam)… well probably not the ultrasound rather the dimly lit room with the soothing hum of the machine fan as well as the warm blanket placed over her (at times, even I was tempted to sleep, but I guess that would be frowned upon being a respectful adult and all). Katie and I were looking intently at the screen in which the ultrasound technician kept flying through different images, snapping pictures as well as sound clips. I don’t know what Katie and I were expecting to see, because to the untrained eye it just looked like a bunch of gobble-y-gook. After about an hour, give or take, the technician finished everything she had to do and went to get the doctor for a final look. When the doctor came in the room both her and the technician brought up a specific area of Isla’s insides back onto the screen. They seemed puzzled and were having a hard time finding her gall bladder. At this time, all we knew was this could be a problem or it could be normal, due to the gall bladder being about the size of a piece of dandruff on a 1 month old. One diagnostic test complete, that wasn’t so bad, now on to patient admittance.</p>

                                    <p>Isla was admitted to the IWK hospital mid-December. At just over a month old, that means both of her parents were admitted as well. There was no way I would be spending any time away from my baby girl while she was in the hospital. Work was being very accommodating and they had allowed me to take as much time as I needed before coming back. We headed up to the 7th floor (paediatric unit) to get setup with our accommodations and I headed back to the Snillis’ house to pick up our things. Here I was, in the freezing cold, walking up University Avenue dragging an oversized luggage bag, diaper bag wrapped around one shoulder, another bag draped over the luggage bag, and the u-shaped breast feeding pillow around my neck like those pillows on an air plane (or as I liked to call it: “the flower-patterned hemorrhoid pillow). Why was everyone giving me funny looks? Who knows? When I had arrived back to the hospital Katie and Isla were all settled in and a lovely Gastrointestinal (GI) resident was poking at her belly (Isla’s belly that is). The resident had finished her examination and advised us to get comfortable while we waited for the GI specialist, Dr. R. When Dr. R and the resident arrived, Isla was content in her crib (or space-ship cage, those hospital cribs are intense!). Dr. R went right to the belly poking and I remember the resident saying how interesting it was that all babies, no matter what part of the world you are in, make the same sounds and gestures (I remember thinking: “that is neat.”). After the examination was complete, Dr. R wanted us to sit down and give him our full attention. He was an older doctor with a grey and white speckled beard to which he claimed babies enjoyed due to its resemblance to Santa Claus. Dr. R went right to the explanation of Biliary Atresia and advised us, that with Isla’s symptoms as well as the ultrasound results, he was about 95% sure it was what she had. This news took the wind right from our sails (or shall I say it was a “bomb drop?”) as it was the first time we had a doctor as certain as this. We kept our cool though and listened to him while he drew his, Picasso of a drawing, of the liver-GI tract.</p>

                                    <p>I am now going to explain, in my understanding, what Biliary Atresia is so if you do not want to be schooled please skip through the rest of this paragraph. However, it will be important to understand as we progress through Isla’s life-story… hint, hint, wink, wink. Biliary Atresia is the blockage or absence of liver bile ducts and it impacts approximately 1 in 15K to 20K newborns in North America (fairly rare and not the odds you want to win). They have yet to determine a cause. The bile duct’s job is to secrete bile into our small intestines where it’s job is to assist with the digestion of fat as well as excretion of bilirubin (by-product of recycled red blood cells in the liver as well as turning an adult’s poop brown). Now the problem with this disease is that the bile ducts of the liver as well as the main bile duct outside the liver are damaged or blocked. When these ducts are blocked the bile has a hard time leaving the liver and entering the gut. The bile builds up in the liver and can cause serious damage or cirrhosis (liver tissue replaced with scar tissue) and the damage can be fatal. The procedure they do to correct the atresia is called the Kasai procedure. In this procedure they dissect the diseased bile ducts in the liver, remove the main bile duct, remove the gall bladder, determine where the liver is draining the most bile, and connect the small intestine directly to that part of the liver (pretty big surgery for such a little thing). This procedure corrects the atresia (or blockage), but it does not stop the progression of the disease in about 95% of cases. It is not a perfect solution and the bile still builds up in the liver causing damage over time. The main objective of the procedure is to tie the child over until they are older and can support a liver transplant more effectively. Essentially, this is what was explained to us by Dr. R and his diagram as well as our own personal research (take what you read online with a grain of salt, though).</p>

                                    <p>Whoa! If you think that was a lot to take in, try listening to that in real life and try learning that your beautiful little lady could potentially have this disease. Dr. R was very good with his explanation as well as making sure we fully understood. We both nodded, both doctors left the room, and then came the waterworks. We both just let the emotions out. We cried, we held each other, we swore to the high heavens, and kept asking why? Being well versed in the woes of healthcare, we are always frustrated by how much people abuse the gift of health. Smoking, excessive drinking, hard drugs, eating crap, and not exercising to name a few. Most adults that get admitted into the hospital are not innocent in their ailments, some do very little to prevent them from happening and literally suck the life out of the “free” healthcare system we benefit from. Then we have a sweet and innocent new life brought into the world plagued with a disease; it’s not fair. It was one of the hardest pills to swallow, being first time parents and all. It is scary enough having a newborn with all of the unknowns, fears, excitement, and joy, but add a disease into that mix and you are playing a whole new ball game. Thank god I have had my amazing wife by my side for so long and knowing that this is just one more challenge in our relationship. We always face everything head on and together and we were determined that this would not end that. Once we vented and got through that sudden blow, we gathered ourselves and put our guard back up. We knew this was going to be a long trip to the hospital and we would have to be strong for everyone. I mean, who wants a room full of adults hysterically crying? That wouldn’t help anyone. At this point, we knew that there was definitely something wrong with our baby girl, not necessarily Biliary Atresia but definitely something. The rest of the week was dedicated to getting to the bottom of what was causing her jaundice and pale poop. Thank god babies are very resilient, too bad daddy isn’t so much</p>

                                    <hr>

                                    <p>Our first week started out with a bang. Katie and I had come to terms with the fact that Isla most likely had Biliary Atresia, but there was still a little hope in the back of our minds that she might still be fucking with us (too bad it wasn’t April fools). Our mornings began with wake up sessions from the blood lab. Isla, the tough cookie, did not really mind the little poke on the bottom of her heel. What she did mind was the restraint caused by one of the technicians holding her leg straight as the other quickly scraped blood into a test tube, drop by drop (the girl just liked to move it, move it!).</p>

                                    <p>One of us would then sneak out to the kitchen with our pre-mixed formula and disposable baby bottle, heat some water in the microwave for the formula, and quickly creep back to the room to feed our baby girl. We would then order some breakfast from “Dial-for-Dining,” shit, shower, shave, and prepare for our day. Dial for Dining, by the way, was the food service setup the IWK had where you would choose an appetizer, entree, two drinks and a desert all for the price of $10. The food was all pretty good, unlike times I have stayed in the hospital choking back a cold bagel and some Jell-O. The food was ordered via the cafeteria and hand delivered right to our room. I still dream of the mango frozen yoghurt… Besides all of the tests, our days carried out very similarly: blood test, Dial for Dining time, eat the enormous amount of food provided by friends and family (thanks mom, Tabitha’s mom Michelle, Dad, etc), colour in adult colouring books with friends, telling Vanessa how awesome she was for house-sitting (seriously, she cleaned the cat litter, ran the dishwasher, fed our three cats, and took pictures of them for us; she was their new mother), and sleep in our single hospital bed (if we didn’t hold on to each other, one of us was bound to fall off).</p>

                                    <p>One day we had a short older nurse with spiked dark hair (who quickly became one of our favourite nurses) introduce us to an amazing little sugar solution called “toot-sweet.” For those of you who do not know, this clear sugar-liquid contained in a small purple tube, was named “baby crack” on the paediatric floor. You could be giving your baby a “Horse Bite” while dunking her head into the toilet for a swirly and as long as a drop of this liquid touched her lips, she would probably be giggling the whole time. Seriously though, the mornings became a lot easier with this shit. Instead of two technicians standing over our daughter grabbing and poking while we sat on our bed red eyed and glaring; it would be two technicians as well one of us squeezing one drop at a time of Toot-Sweet as soon as Isla’s eyebrow so much as twitched. Isla could be mid-screech and as soon as the drop touched her lips she would immediately stop, start slurping like a pudgy toddler with a popsicle on a scorching hot day, and moan with each suck as though to say: “it’s so good, once it hits your lips, it’s so good!” Needless to say, this shit was da-bomb and was used several more times during our stay..</p>

                                    <p>We felt as though we met with every professional at the IWK including the kitchen sink. Everyone wanted their piece of the pie with Isla and for the most part they were necessary. We met with all of the Gastrointestinal (GI) specialists including Dr. R’s two other colleagues, the awkwardly quiet resident, and a plethora of medical students. Katie and I quickly became the experts on Biliary Atresia and had to sometimes explain it to the IWK professionals since it was such a rare disease (Dr. R claimed that they only receive 1-2 cases a year in the Maritimes). There was nutritionist who setup Isla with her special formula concentration as well as vitamin regimen. There was a social worker who checked in to see how we were coping with everything. There was the genetics team who created a pedigree as well as going over Isla’s diagnostic plan for their branch of medicine (which turns out, was the bulk of her diagnostic work). This was quite the situation and Katie and I learned more than we wanted to about our families. Luckily My mom as well as Katie’s mom were both in the room and they had a better grasp of our family disease history. “Great uncle Jib fell off a ladder when he was trying to peep on his neighbour and ever since he has a permanent erection,” said my mom. Katie’s mom said, “Cousin Beedoowapdo from Zambia got herpes from his pet Orangutan, but they are still in love.” I am surprised the poor geneticist stuck around as long as she did, however pale her skin turned. The genetics team was trying to rule out a disorder called Alagille syndrome, which can cause fewer than normal bile ducts in the liver, amongst many other things. The doctors understandably wanted to be 100% sure Isla’s condition was Biliary Atresia before performing the surgery.</p>

                                    <h2>Diagnostic Week</h2>

                                    <p>I will summarize her diagnostics test for the first ten days of our stay in the following paragraph. The first stop of the week was x-ray. We headed down to the x-ray room where we were met with an exceptionally bubbly x-ray technician. We got to put on the bullet-proof vests and hold Isla straight out with her arms up and legs down (she clearly did not enjoy this). They wanted to have a look at her spine since Alagille can cause an abnormal curvature in the spine. Next, we headed to the ophthalmologist (eye doctor) to check her eyes. During this test the eye doctor was checking for common Alagille indicators such as iris and optic disc issues. This was the first test where the doctor essentially took a quick glance and said there was nothing wrong (one step closer to a complete diagnosis of Biliary Atresia). The next test was the sweat test. This one was an interesting one to me. It was clear the technology has not changed in decades. The nurse rubbed a cream on Isla’s leg, hooked her up to an electrode machine, and wrapped her leg (with electrode attached) in a bag. The electrode caused her to sweat, the sweat was then captured by the bag, and the sample was sent off to test whether she was at risk for Cystic Fibrosis or not. The final piece of the genetics diagnostic puzzle was to perform an echo of Isla’s heart (ultrasound of the heart). This test was the second time we received confirmation from the nurse/technician that Isla was not at risk for Alagille (It’s also when I started wondering why we had to do so many damn genetics tests including the following blood draw). Part way through the test the nurse was looking closely at Isla’s heart and simply said: “These are textbook images, I could use them to teach a class on the anatomy of the heart.” At the end of the echo, Katie and I had come to terms with the likeliness of Isla needing surgery for Biliary Atresia. It was great that she did not have some extremely rare genetic disorder, but was still a chronic disease nonetheless, which was going to change her life. No matter where we were in the hospital, be it walking through the halls, in x-ray, blood lab, ultrasound, or paediatric unit, people always went out of their way to let us know how beautiful our little lady was. They were always astonished at how well behaved she was and shocked when we told them what we were at the hospital for (she did not look like a sickly baby, maybe a little yellow, but not sickly). Of course, Katie and I already knew how awesome our bambino was and always obliged with a gracious thank you.</p>

                                    <h2>Finalizing Diagnosis</h2>

                                    <p>After the wondrous week of test after test, we met with the GI team as well as the surgery team to go over what to expect. They advised us of the good news that Isla was healthy in every way besides her liver function. They were all on the same page now and wanted to advise us of what to expect with surgery (the Kasai procedure would be performed (see last post for explanation) as well as a biopsy of liver tissue to see the extent of damage). At this time, Isla’s name was making its rounds around the hospital. Katie’s friend Tabitha works as a nurse in the operating room so the surgical team was forewarned of the awesomeness which was Isla. Even so, they were blown away by her cuteness and quickly took a liking to our little munchkin. The surgery team was made up of several nurses, a resident, an anesthesiologist, and four surgical doctors (Dr. Superstar (performed the surgery), Dr. M, Dr, D and the surgical fellow, Dr. Victoria (who was nothing short of a great person)). The surgery team assured us that we would have the A-team, but they were not sure which one of them was going to perform the surgery as it was getting closer to Christmas and the schedule was out of whack. We had one more test to do in order to finalize the need of surgery and that was the HIDA scan. Isla had been taking a crap-ton of a red coloured liquid all week in order to dilate her liver vessels for the HIDA scan (Phenobarbital). It was the end of the week and we headed down to see the nuclear medicine team for Isla’s scan. They would be performing it once today and once more a day later in order to get clear results. We brought Isla into the room and set her up on, what looked like, an MRI machine. They had to administer a radioactive dye via intravenous so that the machine could pickup the tree-like structure of her liver vessels. The whole point of this test was to see if and how well Isla’s bile was moving through her liver and into her gut. Besides the stubborn team jabbing Isla multiple times in order to administer the dye (then settling on sticking the needle in a vein of her head), the test was fairly straight forward. However, seeing my sweet little girl stabbed by a needle on each of her appendages made me so upset I had to leave the room. As we were looking at the screen, which was pretty neat, neither one of us thought that we could see drainage into her gut. This was confirmed early the next day when we met with the surgery team again and they advised us that they would be performing surgery on Isla. One more official blow to our nerves, but this time we were prepared.</p>

                                    <h2>Pre-Surgery</h2>

                                    <p>It was finally official, after the grueling tens days of diagnosis, that Isla certainly had Biliary Atresia (of course not 110% sure until she was opened up, but 99.9% repeating). We found comfort in the amazing surgery team and Tabitha assured us, now that we knew who was performing the surgery, that Dr. Superstar was the best person to do it. Dr. Superstar had spoken with us about how Biliary Atresia, however un-ideal it was, was the best of the worst things for Isla to have. Firstly, babies are very resilient and the liver is especially so. The liver is one of the only organs that regenerates (thankfully for all of you alcohol abusers out there) and only needs to have a blood type match in order to donate a live piece of liver. Secondly, The Kasai procedure is not a permanent fix for 95% of all patients, but the goal is to prolong the time needed before the child needs a transplant (gives the child time to grow before partaking in a major surgery). Thirdly, Dr, Superstar was the only doctor on the surgical team who had performed the surgery before, so he was the right man for the job. These facts shed some light on Katie and my concerns and I am pretty sure we both decided, right then and there, that we would both be volunteering to be her liver donor. This would mean that we would have to slightly tweak our lifestyle: drastically cutting back on alcohol consumption, lowering our BMI’s, and continuing to stay focused on a healthy living/eating plan. We already actively pursued these goals, but raising Isla under these conditions so that she can make healthy choices herself, was the final kick in the pants for Katie and I. The surgery was booked for the 22<sup>nd</sup> of December and other than being at home, we learned that the IWK was an amazing place to be for Christmas.</p>

                                    <h2>Surgery</h2>

                                    <p>The day had arrived, and saying that Katie and I were on edge was an understatement. Luckily Katie’s good friend, Tabitha, volunteered to be with us when we handed Isla over to the surgery team. Since we were headed to Tabitha’s place of work, we had no problem navigating the hospital to where we needed to go. Of course, when we arrived at the waiting room all of Tabitha’s co-workers needed to see the famous Isla and it was nice to see how great the staff was in whom we were entrusting our babies’ wellbeing to. I will never forget the final moments before the team took her into surgery. The anesthesiologist had come out to explain the procedure, but I did not hear a word he said, I was just nodding and going through the motions. I had my sweet baby girl in my arms, Tabitha, Katie and I had all kissed her “good-luck.” Then the younger nurse, must not have seen me kiss Isla, and said: “daddy has to kiss his little girl.” I kissed her, longer this time, said I loved her, looked up and saw the whole nursing team was crying as well, and that was it for me. I don’t think I have ever cried so much in my life, the cliche tough guy in me could no longer hold back. It was official, Isla had broken down my tough exterior and I would forever have a soft spot in my heart for her. The only other thought I had besides Isla was: “this poor innocent lady who just so happened to hit the button in the elevator to the surgery floor, only to have the doors open up to Katie, Tabitha, and I holding each other in this state.” We gathered our composure as we headed up the elevator back to the 7th floor where both of our families were waiting. We quickly gathered our things and moved to the surgical unit, which is where Isla would be heading after her surgery. </p>

                                    <p>That night everyone convinced me to finally leave the hospital, since I could not be by Isla’s side in surgery, and we stayed at the Snillis’ house. Watching some movies, having a beer and sleeping in their comfortable bed (a straw bed would be desirable after two weeks in a single and cot) was much needed. Besides Katie and I jumping and staring at each other intently each time a phone or microwave beeped, it was a pretty straightforward evening. Dr. Superstar had promised to have his staff inform us periodically of surgery updates, which were all: “progressing well.” Finally the final update came from Dr. Superstar himself who called to let us know the surgery went well and that he was ready to meet with us to go over post surgery expectations as well as to see how we were doing. The post surgery recovery stretched through Isla’s first Christmas, but I will talk about this in more detail in my next post. I promise, it will all be good news and then we can get back to the crazy-silly day-to-day shenanigans of Isla and her family!</p>

                                    <h2>Recovery Week</h2>

                                    <p>We all survived the surgery. Isla had about a week of recovery on the surgical unit of the IWK Hospital. The rooms on this unit were much bigger. I'd say they were the Hilton to the Holiday Inn of the Paediatric unit. It was definitely hard to see our baby girl all doped up with an IV, nasogastric tube (NG) coming out of her nose and a pulse monitor connected to her toe. That damn monitor was a pain in the ass, too. If it moved one nanometer, from one of her toe hairs to the other, alarms would sound and wake up the neighbourhood. Katie and I were good "parents of a patient," too. We were on the ball with keeping track of her poops/pees, feedings and medicine intake before surgery. However, right after surgery we unfortunately had a little break from this due to the IV and nasogastric tube. While these two things were in we were no longer needed for feeding Isla or providing medicine as this was all done via the IV. In addition, the nasogastric tube was in place to suck out all of the crap from her stomach. Our lively little "ham" of a daughter was now quite lethargic, which was the toughest thing for me to see. We were all waiting on the glorious FART. The fart was the sign that she could have the NG tube taken out and we could begin feeding her again. I never thought I would be in such anticipation of flatulence in my life. Luckily, Isla was in a hurry as well, since no more than two days post-surgery (December 23rd, 2015) that puff of methane from her cute little buttocks emerged. Confetti fell from the ceilings, a choir sang in the background and horns blew throughout the floor. “Isla has passed gas!” The town crier proclaimed… Our charting began immediately with the first report being...</p>

                                    <p>There weren't many more eventful moments after "the bum burp." She went back to breast feeding and formula. A couple days later the pain medications were weaned off as Isla’s mother and I remained vigilant. It's hard enough to measure pain in a speaking adult let alone a two month old, but we got good at determining what certain cries and demeanour meant now. In case you haven't been paying attention, we ended up spending Christmas at the hospital. To end off the "post surgery" story I will explain two things (out of many) that the IWK provided, which blew Katie and I away. There is a Ronald McDonald house built into the hospital on the third floor. They periodically put on events such as: dinners, decorating, gift wrapping, etc. On Christmas Day they put on an extra special surprise, in collaboration with McKelvies, where they served the traditional Christmas dinner. It was all very delicious with tender turkey, stuffing, potatoes, gravy, etc. The second thing was the "gift room." If I was a kid (don't even start, Katie!) and happened to stumble across this room, I would be sharting in my batman shorts while crying with excitement. The room was FULL of presents from floor to ceiling, ranging from puzzles to full princess Elsa costumes. Being parents of a patient, we were allowed to pick out two large items, a onesie, some books, and wrap them up on the spot for Isla's surprise first Christmas (see main picture on last blog post to see the aftermath of her Christmas). Until this day I am still in awe of how far the community and IWK Foundation go in support of the hospital. Take it from me people; your donations go to the right place and are very much appreciated!</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>Heading Home</h2>

                                    <p>Although our stay was a gazzilion times longer than we expected, we were tickled fancy to be leaving on the 28th of December. Just under a month in the hospital, after little miss Isla only being alive for just over a month, and we were finally heading home... Phew!! Until this day (almost 6 months since Isla was born), we still don't quite know what normal is for our little bambino; we probably will never know. Before leaving the hospital, one of the things Dr. R advised us of was Isla's susceptibility to infection. She now had a dirty organ (intestine) attached directly to a clean organ (liver) so infection risk was higher for her than the average baby. Any time Isla has any symptoms of infection or a high temperature, we need to head into the hospital and get her setup for tests to rule out the common cold, flu, urinary tract infection, etc. If it is none of the usual ailments causing the higher temperature then it could be an infection of her surgery site called Cholangitis. Knowing our luck so far, what do you think happened after about a month back at home? Isla generated a temperature of over 38 degrees Celsius, which is concerning (keep this in mind "new parents"). Just like robots, Katie and I packed a bag, gathered ourselves and rushed to the hospital (about a minute away). I called the IWK prior to heading to our local hospital and the doctor-on-call immediately called the Valley Regional to inform them of our arrival. We were warned at the IWK that we would have to advocate for Isla’s condition when we headed into the ER with Isla having a fever. Due to her condition being so rare there would be a high chance of it being dismissed as the common cold as well as her father going to jail for slapping the dismissing doctor in the face. Thankfully this was not the case at the Valley Regional and her fever was taken very seriously. They ruled out all of the common issues which cause a fever and we headed to the IWK that night (1.5 hours away).</p>

                                    <p>Just one more learning experience in the life of Isla. We ended up staying at the IWK for a week while Isla was on IV antibiotics. Cholangitis is hard to diagnose and can be very detrimental to her surgery. Needless to say, they essentially just pumped her with a bunch of antibiotics for at least a week and monitored her symptoms. Not a whole lot happened during this trip besides the "poop explosion surprise."</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>The Poop Exlplosion Surprise</h2>

                                    <p>We went through the regular cycle of nurses and “dial for dining” again during our week long stay. There was one bubbly blond nurse who was exceptional this time and became one of our new favourites. She just understood us, was easy to talk to, and very considerate. I guess Isla had a different opinion of her, though. I always got a kick out of said nurse, because late at night she would do her best to tippy toe into our room, undo Isla's Velcro “Swaddle Me” blanket one Velcro ringlet at a time (see Amazon store below. These blankets are amazing if your baby likes to pull a Houdini and kick themselves free of all blankets in turn waking up the whole house with their tired screeches), and quickly silence the IV machine's beeping. Henceforth she will be called: “ninja nurse.” On this particular night our ninja nurse tried her best to check on Isla without a peep, but Isla wasn't having it. She screeched to the high heavens, and since Katie and I were experts on her cry-a-nese language now, we knew this was the "I just shit my pantaloons" cry. Katie quickly flipped over me on the single bed and landed on all fours in one foul swoop. She hustled over to the very apologetic ninja nurse, said: "no worries, kemosabe," and swapped out Isla's diaper. Problem was, during this somewhat smooth move (pun intended), ninja nurse was standing just a tad bit close to the crib. The poor nurse was actually standing right smack dab in the middle of the "blast radius." In the split second it took Katie to take one diaper off, say: "hot damn," and slap the clean diaper on; ninja nurse fell back in a slow motion reverse running-man. She was hit! Our small two month old, 10 pounder, released a heat-seeking, soft serve stream of shit in a three foot trajectory all over the nurse's scrubs. We all had a little laugh, Isla had a little fart, ninja nurse wrote down Isla's address for revenge, and we settled back to sleep on our two foot by three foot bed made for elves. The problem is, you can't get mad at something which can unleash such evil just to end it off with a face like...</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>Made it in One Piece</h2>

                                    <p>We made it through the infection scare. Five IV lines later and some of the best poop colours Isla has produced and we were on our way home; for the second time in one month. We have not been back to the hospital since, knock on wood, besides Isla's monthly checkups/blood collection at the GI clinic.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2>What Next?</h2>

                                    <p>If you think the poop explosion was bad, you just wait to see what kinds of mischief our little ham has put her parents through, “post explosion.” We are close to Isla’s daddy being home all by his lonesome, Isla starts to develop more of a personality, the night of terror, and much much more. Stay tuned folks!</p>

                                    <p>Who said parenting was hard? That person is nuts! Just kidding, parenting can be tough, but again it is all about perspective. When you have a sick child it can be tricky to determine whether fussiness is due to their disease or if fussiness is due to normal baby things (teething, gas, etc). We are at the point now where the normal baby things are a breeze. I have seen first time parents jump at any sniffle with their babies and we have been so over that. When you have to be on guard for things like: blood in the stool, fever due to intestinal infection, jaundice worsening, rashes, excessive itching, fluid in the abdomen, loss of appetite, etc; a quick sniffle or whimper doesn’t phase you anymore. All of this doesn't mean we haven’t had our fair share of “hair pulling” moments caused by normal baby things throughout Isla’s first half of a year. </p>

                                    <h2>The Four Month Regression</h2>

                                    <p>“Man we have an easy baby.” “She can basically take care of herself.” Those were some of the common statements Katie and I used to make in the first few months of Isla’s life. In the grand scheme of things, that is still mainly the case, but we hit a little speed bump at four months. Leading up to four months Isla would cry if she was hungry, she would cry if she was poopy, and she would cry a little when she was sleepy. In fact, most of the time she would just pass out wherever she was or on whomever she was on when she got tired. I swear, she could be sleeping on a hungry shark in the middle of a bump’n rave concert. We soon realized that allowing her to dictate when she was sleeping (or not) was a huuuuge mistake. It was sometime in February, Katie and I were arriving home from a trip to Halifax (I will refer to Halifax as the “city” from now on. (Typing three less letters caters to my laziness so well). On this particular night, It was much later than Isla’s 6-7pm bedtime when we started the bedtime routine. The routine was as follows: heat up a bottle of milk, start running the bath water to a perfect temperature (we learned that the perfect temperature was reached when the first thing Isla did when her butt touched the water was to let the pee rip), plop Isla in the bath (plastic tub-like structure with a fabric ramp), dry her off in her Klu Klux Klan-like towel (essentially has a hood on it which raises to the notorious pointed top like that lovely group of outstanding citizens), baby massage (“It puts the lotion on it’s skin”), clean that stinky surprise off her bum, leg and back, feed her the bottle (feed her the "milk" from the bottle for all of you literal folks), read her a story (if it’s mom’s turn) or do a little dance with her (if it’s dad’s turn), wrap her like a mummy in her Swaddle Me blanket, turn on the mobile’s light and music, top it all off with a soother in the mouth. Is it just me or does everyone else automatically think of Maggie from The Simpsons as soon as their baby starts sucking on her soother or dumb-tit or pacifier or sookie; whatever the hell you call it? (I have grown fond of dumb-tit ever since I heard that name a few months back. I think it caters to my child-like sense of humour or as some people call it “immaturity”). Unfortunately, this night was different. Usually she lets off a long comforting sigh and tinkle as soon as we sit her in the warm bath (much like the sound daddy makes when he passes a large amount of gas), but tonight she was fussing and crying… ok, we’ll chalk that up as a fluke (maybe I bumped her leg when I sat her in the bath). Usually she looks up at me with that creepy smile (as stated in the blog introduction) when I lay her on her changing pad for a poop wipe, good-luck bum spank, and an anti-bum rash lubing, but tonight she was shrieking as soon as her head touched down… ok, now this is getting a bit out of the ordinary. Usually she rolls her eyes to the back of her head while we feed her that perfectly warmed bottle of milk, but tonight she was choking on it while she was crying in between gulps… shit! What the shit is going on with her? This was our first anxiety rendering experience of: “is her disease causing her pain?” “Is this just something normal for babies and our lack of experience is getting the best of us?” We tried everything. Group hugs, pep talks (“You can do this Isla, we believe in you!” “Please go to sleep or your mom and I are going to take up heroin as a hobby”), more milk, dances, double wrapping her swaddle, turning the room temperature up, turning the room temperature down, singing her lullabies… Oh! Dad to the rescue… she always settles when we put her in her car seat and swing her back and forth… NOPE… didn’t work… Holy son of a Vondruke! It was getting to be close to 3am now and Katie and I were starting to get cranky with each other. There were moments we were just sitting there with blood shot eyes, swaying back and forth, staring at a blank wall, with our hair pulled out of our heads and a baby screaming in the background. Well there’s only one more thing I can think of… let’s go for a drive for as long as it takes. I’ll fucking drive to China if I have to (by the way, a lot of the baby materials I mentioned above are on my Amazon store, check it out on the bottom of this webpage!).</p>

                                    <h2>Let’s Go Do a “B” & “E”</h2>

                                    <p>There is not much area to drive in our small town of 6,094 people (yeah I just Googled that and that was the population in 2011, do some’in!). If we drove through the greater Annapolis Valley area we would have a whole lot more terrain to cover surrounded by farmlands and mountains, but I didn’t want to take any chances. If we finally got this devil child to sleep I was pulling a U-turn (a Granny-like slow-ass U-turn as to not disturb our sleeping beauty) and we were going to drive the car right into her nursery, car seat and all (so we did not have to lift her out of her car seat to place her in bed. Protect the sleep!) We just finished our 50th lap around Paddy’s Pub (that one-way stretch of road which goes in a circle in downtown Kentville and probably totals 1 km). All of a sudden the crying stopped, thank the lord almighty. Katie reached to the back where Isla was sitting and performed her routine “check if she’s breathing” check. (Get off your high horse people, you know how ridiculous it is, but you’ve still done it). FINALLY! she was out cold (asleep, that is). We were on the home-stretch, literally, and all of a sudden I noticed an ominous sight ahead. God Dammit! It was a fucking road block. The blue and red lights were flashing, the cops were laughing and flashing their flashlights in the car windows (I guess it was 4am on a Saturday night and there are drunks out there thinking they are Nascar drivers). What freaking luck we have! If they only knew the shit storm they could potentially cause. Yes, I thought about it: “Should I rev this SUV up to it’s zero to sixty in 50 minutes, fly through this traffic stop  like we just performed a break and entry, flip the cops the bird as we blow past them, enjoy our next 12 months in jail while Isla gets a nice cozy room in a foster home at 4 months old?” Yeah probably not the best idea, but believe me, it was intriguing. Instead we begrudgingly pulled up to the traffic stop like the good obedient citizens we are, I rolled down the window, and the officer flashed his light in. I didn’t realize it at the time, but the officer probably had his own thoughts the instant his flashlight illuminated our vehicle: “Two citizens, visibly distressed, messy hair, dishevelled clothing, maybe domestic         dispute, ask the driver if he has been drinking, ask the woman in the passenger seat if everything is alright, put your hand on your gun  and… hold on.” Then he shined the light into the back seat where a baby was peacefully sleeping, immediately understands (must be a father himself) and says with a sympathetic tone: “Have a good night folks.”</p>   

                                    <p>We arrived back home and luckily Isla was still snoozing. We turned the car off, closed the car doors like we were trying to close them on a balloon without popping it, took Isla out of her carseat in a sloth-like fashion and ventured into her nursery. I think we got as far as her nursery door and: “WAAAAAAAAAAA WAAAAAAA!” I think both of our hearts skipped a few beats and we almost passed out with exhaustion. The anxiety set in again and we began to worry about her health. Maybe she was in pain? We should give the GI clinic a call tomorrow, just to be safe. The rest of the night was a blur, but I remember sometime between 5am and 6am Katie decided to strip down to her skivvies and cuddle with Isla on the couch. After about 20 minutes of the skin-to-skin cuddling I remember the crying subsided and I was dreaming.</p>

                                    <h2>Do Some Research Ya Dumbasses</h2>

                                    <p>We woke up a few hours later. The day was back to normal as well as our lovely little lady. Katie decided to do a little research and found an article on “4 month sleep regression.” Essentially, when a baby hits approximately the four month mark their brain gets to a certain level of development where they will wake themselves up. Their sleep cycles begin to get all out of whack and some start having night terrors. I was a little skeptical at first, but I was willing to do anything in order to avoid another night of terror like the previous one. The advice from the linked website provided a solution. They recommended that babies need to be put on a sleep schedule from the time they are born. When they are Isla’s age it was recommended to have her stay fed and woken up early in the morning. Do not allow her to stay awake for any longer than an hour and a half in between naps and have her nap no longer than two hours, but no shorter than an hour. You continue this routine of napping-awake-feeding schedule until they are about 6 months old and then you start to lengthen the awake duration. This all seemed like a lot of work, but I am here to say: Isla is now almost 7 months old and I stick to this schedule like it’s a fanatical religion. I have it built into my alarm clock on my cell phone and besides the couple of times her fussiness actually was caused by her disease progression (keep an eye out for these updates in the next few blog posts), there have been no more issues with sleeping at night. During our regular monthly clinic visits to see the GI folks we can confidently say: “Isla sleeps well, barely ever fussy, eats well, man we have an easy baby, she can basically take care of herself.” </p>

                                    <p>So, from one newbie to another, get those little punks on a schedule. It will save your sleep, sanity and keep you out of jail.</p>

                            <p>To say the three dudes on this podcast are entertaining is a gross understatement. I started listening to their podcast before Isla was diagnosed with her disease. I was intrigued by the story of one of the hosts actually living with Cystic Fibrosis and having seen him on television in the past; I knew the podcast would be hilarious. The three hosts of Sickboy provide a disambiguation of sickness ranging from adult circumcision to depression to end stage cancer. They take a no holds barred approach and discuss everything under the sun with their guests whom are inflicted with an illnesses.

                            <p>The forum scene on the internet, especially Facebook, for diseases is very dire to say the least. There is a bunch of negativity, misinformation and people just looking for a handout. I stumbled upon Health Unlocked and finally found legitimate information on Biliary Atresia.
